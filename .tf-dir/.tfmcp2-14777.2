Now I'm editing within vim in the same terminal, which is better. Much better. Possibly usable.
Well, I tried using screens, and it still opened it in xterm. I'm not sure if I have a better way to do this yet.
Well, this is a step above editing within the moo, but I think it might drive me a little batty.
I'm adding new text. This is here. It is here and it is there.
So this is a second line. It's working, but this terminal is horrible.
Now I'm in the MOO editor.
