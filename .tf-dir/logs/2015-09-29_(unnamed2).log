~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
How do I get a character?
     
There are two options on Tales for your first character. You may take a 
pregenerated character from the +roster, or you may generate your own by 
entering the 'Create a Character' exit from the first room, or going straight 
into Chargen from the OOC Nexus. However, one of your first two characters 
must be from the +roster - and all noble characters must be from the +roster.
    
See 'news character' to create a character.
See '+help roster' and 'news roster' to select a character.
See 'news website', 'news policy alts' and 'news roster faq' for more 
information.

                       Tales of Ta'veren II -- News Age                       
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
Age is a defining aspect for your characterizations on Tales of Ta'veren II.
Is your character young and naieve, or older and worldly?   Typically, the
younger have had fewer experiences, but are more flexible than the aged,
who've developed tried and true habits, and have more time to hone their
talents.  
    
The life span of people in the Wheel of Time world is somewhat longer than it
might be in equivalent Real World cultures or historical periods.  Living
conditions, sanitation, and sanitary habits tend to be quite good amongst all
save the poorest individuals.  Though Healthcare is not particularly advanced 
(a result of hedge medicine and cultural reliance on the One Power, perhaps),
certain habits such as washing one's hands between patients and quarantining 
the ill are understood and widely practiced.  Practices such as Bloodletting,
Leeching, and the like are considered obscene and are not practiced.  The
result is a generally healthly populace, in which individuals typically reach
the age of 75, and often live longer still.
    
The age you select for you character is used to calculate how many Skill Points
you will recieve in Chargen.
     
Aging exacts a heavy toll on people - their senses may lose acuity, they may
become weaker of less dexterous, etc. When you character reaches a certain Age,
whether in Chargen or during play, the character generation system will
calculate the chance of whether Age has negatively affected your character.

==============================================================================
                      Tales of Ta'veren II -- News Age II                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
HUMANS
The maximum age you can select for a normal human character is 75.  This upper
limit is in place because your character will continue ageing as you play it. 
Ageing typically begins to affect humans around 65 years of age.
   
CHANNELERS
Manifestation of the One Power seem to be linked to the onset of puberty. 
Children cannot Channel, and it is impossible to even determine if the child
will be able to harness the One Power.  Puberty sets in between 16-18 years of
age in the Wheel of Time world, so if you intend to play a Wilder, your
character must be at least sixteen years of age.  Should you wish to play a
'discovered' Channeler, this minimum is unnecessary - but your abilitiles 
cannot be so discovered until after the onset of puberty.
   
FEMALE CHANNELERS
Women who can Channel find that their aging slows down in their mid-twenties,
particularly if they channel regularly.  These women can live much, much longer
than the average human being.  The maximum Age a female channeler can select is
475 years.  Negative aging affects such characters at 300 years of age.
   
AES SEDAI
If you apply to play a full Aes Sedai in Chargen, the minimum age you can 
choose for you character is 60 years.  The average age to be raised to Aes 
Sedai is from 25 to 35 years.  Since the characters who role-play their way up
from novice fill our the younger ages of the age spectrum, those who wish to
start play as full Sedai have to be set up as older characters to round out the
Tower's population.
   
Aes Sedai experience slowed aging, similar to other female Channelers.  Their
lifespan is much longer that of the average human being, but shorther than that
of other female Channelers (This is probably due to holding the Oath Rod, but
that is not In-Character knowledge).  The maximum age that an Aes Sedai may
select is 275 years.  The effects of aging begin to take their toll on Aes
Sedai from 180 years onwards.

                     Tales of Ta'veren II -- News Age III                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
MALE CHANNELERS
Age poses less of a concern to Male Channelers, who must contend with the 
Taint. 
 
Male Channelers tend to have much more limited life spans than those of other
characters, typically living no more than 10 years after the onset of their
Channeling abilities.  Otherwise, Male Channelers are identical to Female
Channelers for the purposes of determining their minimum age, and would live
equally as long, were they not so Tainted.
   
RESTRICTED POWERS AND AGE
Various restricted character types have abilities that, like the ability to
Channel the One Power, begin to manifest during puberty, or shortly
thereafter. 
  
These restricteds include:  Viewers, Sniffers, Wolfkin, and Dreamwalkers.  As a
result, no character with these abilities will be able to set their age lower
than 16.
   
RESTRICTED SKILLS AND AGE
There are some restricted character types that display remarkable skill and
training - something not easily acquired in one's youth.  As a result
Weaponmasters, including the Blademaster, have a minimum age of 30 in Chargen. 
It is acceptable to role-play the process of achieving the necessary skill
levels to claim one of these titles at an age younger than 30, but such focus
and dutiful attention to detail is often lost on the very young.
  
WARDERS
The fighting men of the White Tower are trained rigorously from young adulthood
until they are men grown.  As a result, Trainees often join the Tower as young
as 16, but it is rare that a Proven is given his Fancloth cloak before the age
of 30.  Furthermore, the Tower rarely accepts men that are older than twenty,
unless they can show that they are more than merely competent warriors:  The
White Tower accepts only the best.
  
OGIER
The Ogier age much more slowly than human beings, and live for a much longer
period of time.  They are not considered to reach maturity until 90 or 100
years of age.  As a general guide, 1 human year of age is equivalent to 5 Ogier
years.  So an Ogier who's 200 years old would be equivalent in age to a human
of 40.
   
If you selected the Ogier culture, the youngest age you can select in Chargen 
is 80.  The oldest age you can select is 475.  Ogier begin to feel the effects
of advancing age from 300 years onwards.

                       Tales of Ta'veren II -- News Aiel                      
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
The Aiel live east of the Spine of the World, in an arid desert they call the
Three-Fold Land, and others call the Aiel Waste. The daytime heat of the 
Waste can kill those unaccustomed to it, but the nights are cold. Poisonous 
plants and animals are found throughout the Three-Fold Land. The Aiel divide
themselves into twelve clans, though they sometimes speak of a thirteenth 
clan. Each clan is lead by a Clan Chief.
    
Aiel culture, customs and family relations are very complex and a complete 
mystery to peoples in other parts of the world. Ji'e'toh is the rigid and 
elaborate system that governs the Aiel society. Ji'e'toh permeates all 
interactions in Aiel life, from fighting to marriage. 
    
Because of the feuds between clans, the Blight at their northern border and 
the harsh conditions of the Waste, the Aiel have a strong warrior tradition. 
Each warrior is a member of one of twelve warrior societies. Female warriors 
are culturally accepted, and belong to the Maidens of the Spear warrior 
society. Women hold other important roles in the Aiel culture. Although all 
Clan Chiefs are male, it is the women who own the land of the Hold 
settlements. Some women become Wise Ones, and act as counsellors and healers.
   
Currently the Shaarad, Goshien and Nakai clans are preferred, since they 
have openly pledged alliegance to the Car'a'carn. We recommend the Far Dareis
Mai, Sovin Nai and Cor Darei warrior societies.

                    Tales of Ta'veren II -- News Background                   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
Each character, should have a background set which explains their past life, 
their family and circumstances. Backgrounds do not have to be tediously long, 
but should be sufficient to give an idea of the character. Backgrounds should
be written for each character with a long term and a short term goal, if 
possible. Backgrounds may be written in the character's voice or third person,
depending on your preference.
           
Below, are listed a few points which should be included for all characters 
where applicable. Please note that backgrounds longer than can be set 
using the +bg command will not be accepted.
  
1. Character's name
2. Character's age
3. Character's place of birth and early life, parents, siblings etc. What
   culture did the character grow up in? What was their family life like? 
   Did they have siblings? What did their family do?
4. Type of character applying for?
5. How did character discover they were a _____? (please be brief)
6. How long has character been a _____? Significant events? 
   (ie. Arches scenarios, Wilder block formation, Wolfkin experience.)
7. What abilities do you see this character having and what parts of 
   their early life might have contributed? How did they spend the previous
   years? Did they learn or do anything of particular interest?
8. What capabilities or powers are you applying for, outside of typical for
   that type of character? (ie, One Power Talents or exceptional strength,
   ter'angreal, One Power forged swords, etc.)
