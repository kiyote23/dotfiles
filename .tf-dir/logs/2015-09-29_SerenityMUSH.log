| |  |     \        | We found a new solar system and used terraforming | |
| |  |      '.      | technology to make hundreds of new earths. The    | |
| |  |    _   `\    | central planets formed the Alliance and decided   | |
| |   \  (_)   |   /  everyone should unite under their rule, a few     | |
| |    '._    / _.' people tried to stop them. After the war those that | |

Welcome to Serenity MUSH.


This file is meant to help you, the player, understand what is going on in
the 'Verse, both in the past and the present, as well as give you knowledge
you will need to determine your character's place in its future.
Many opportunities exist for you within this new, yet ever-changing 'Verse.

This MUSH is dedicated to story development (NEWS POLICY RP FIRST). As such,
the canon series provides a basis for the story, but does not restrict the
scope of the story development. The story on this MUSH can (and *will*) go
wherever the staff and players collectively determine is best for character
development.

Theme    --UNIFICATION WAR-- Page 1
==============================================================================
The War for Unification was the most devastating war in human history. All
those who lived through it are marked, like a scar left behind by an old
wound. Just that some happen to have big scars traced all 'cross their faces
while others have tiny ones hidden away. Outer planets, including Shadow,
Persephone, and Hera formed their own: the Independent Faction
(known as 'Browncoats,' thanks to the brown dusters their soldiers took
to wearing). The Parliament of the Alliance instituted a draft to build its
forces. They were considerably astonished to learn that more than half of the
Independent forces were composed of volunteers. The Alliance (known as the
'Purple Bellies' for their style of dress) had the manpower, the ships, and
technology to make the result of the war a forgone conclusion, but no one
anticipated that freedom would be something so many folk would be willing
to die to protect.

==============================================================================
Theme    --UNIFICATION WAR-- Page 2
==============================================================================

The War raged for just over five years; taking place on land, sea, and in
the dark of space. The largest space battle in terms of scale and human
cost was the Battle of Sturges, one in which countless ships were destroyed,
creating a massive graveyard preserved in the vacuum of the black. The largest
land battle, the one that brought about the end of the war, was fought on the
planet Hera in Serenity Valley. This battle raged on for seven weeks before
the Independent High Command surrendered. Even then, some of the Browncoats
continued to fight on for two weeks after that. Those soldiers who continued
to fight even after being ordered to lay down arms were captured and tried for
war crimes. Ultimately, the Alliance released the soldiers and officers as a
peaceful gesture to those outer planets now under its rule. Some look upon
those who fought in the Battle of Serenity as criminals. Others see them as
big, damn heroes. Since the battles were mostly fought on the Border and
the Rim, the Core planets escaped unscathed. To this day, many outer planets
still bear terrible scars. Shadow was effectively destroyed, and it
remains uninhabitable seven years later. Major cities on Athens were bombed.
Several key land battles were fought on Persephone. Moons that had no
strategic value, such as Whitefall and Jiangyin, were untouched, but they
still suffered as a result of the disruption of trade. Supplies had been hard
to get as it was, and the war made it harder. Almost every person living on
those planets saw their homes leveled, no wonder some folk are still bitter.

Theme    --Here and Now, life in the year 2518-- Page 1
==============================================================================

Life in the 'Verse has returned to normal, leastways on the surface. In truth,
no one has forgotten and few have forgiven. The Alliance now has jurisdiction
over every inhabited planet in the system. The Alliance does not fully
control everything within its far-flung territory. In reality, the Alliance
only has full control over the Core planets. On these worlds, the eyes of the
Alliance are everywhere. Federal police can be called at a moment's notice,
and cameras record every citizens every move. The Core worlds have the best
comforts that money can buy. 'Course, every citizen pays for such security
and comfort with more than a bit of his freedom.

The outer planets were meant to be kept under the same level of strict
control, but the Alliance is short on manpower and ships. They just don't have
enough folk to keep a proper eye on things. Yes, it's true that they hire
security firms to help enforce their laws and maintain order. And they send
their hulking patrol ships out into the black to remind everyone who is in
charge. Still, the cracks in the system are large enough for folk to fly a
Firefly through.

Theme    --Here and Now, life in the year 2518-- Page 2
==============================================================================
Take slavery; for example. Slavery is outlawed by the Alliance government, but
it's an open secret that terraforming companies, mine owners and the
wealthy on the Rim regularly use slave labor in their operations, and pay
big sums for human cargo. Every so often, the Alliance will bust one of
these owners and free the slaves: always looks good on the nightly news.
But then it's back to business as usual. Same with indentured servants.
That's not legal, either, but most folk on the Border planets accept
indentured servitude as a way of life, If you're desperate for the credits
and you got nothing to offer up as collateral except yourself, then that's
what you do. Dohn ma?
=====================================[See: Theme6]============================

THEME6
==============================================================================
Theme    --GOVERNMENTS--  Page 1
==============================================================================
These days, there is only one central government in the 'Verse. Leastways,
that's what the Alliance wants you to believe. It's hard work to rule over
whole star system of bazillions of people and hundreds of worlds, especially
when so many of those worlds are so very far away from the Core. Some in the
Alliance might be starting to wonder if maybe they bit off more protein than
they can chew by trying to extend their control over the outer planets. Some
might be thinking they made a mistake. If they do, they're keeping mighty quiet
about it. These days, the Alliance is all about keeping things quiet. There
are local governments on the Border and Rim planets. Cities have mayors.
Planets have governors. Moons have magistrates. All these answer to the
Alliance. At least, that's the way it's supposed to work. Local officials
on the outer worlds tend to wield heaps more power then their counterparts on
the Core, just because no one's close enough by to tell them they can't.
The Independent Faction is gone, but that isn't to say there are no more
Independents.

THEME7
==============================================================================
Theme    --GOVERNMENTS--  Page 2
==============================================================================
Some are still fighting the war, though now they do it more by being an
annoyance than a major threat. But over the last few years, some of these
folk have left off fighting guerrilla actions and are now fighting on the
political front. Be right interesting to see what happens when someone from
the inside starts prying open secret doors. Then of course, there are the
corporations. Large corporations control powerful lobbies that have
considerable influence inside the government. Favors are traded and eyes
stay blind and the wheels of commerce and politics keep turning. We're going
to take a brief look at all this, just so you know where you stand.

==============================================================================
Theme    --Faith in The 'Verse --  Page 1
==============================================================================
Despite (or maybe because of) man's technological achievements, a majority of
folk in the 'Verse still follow the tenets of one religion or another to some
degree. Buddhism, usually of the Mahayana tradition, is the dominant religion
throughout the system, particularly on the Core planets. Christianity ranks
second, with larger concentrations on the outer worlds, as Christians migrated
away from the centers of Buddhism. Most Christians in the 'Verse follow a
Protestant tradition hailing back to Earth-That-Was. Catholicism still exists,
though the exodus of long ago ended its original structure. One group of
Christian missionaries, the Order of Shepherds, still follows the monastic
tradition. These men and women take vows of poverty and chastity similar to
those of a priest or monk of old. They may live and work in an abbey or
travel the Black.

TIMELINE
==============================================================================
Theme    -- Timeline Information -- Key Dates:                      Page 1
==============================================================================
2506 -- There is a call for settlers on Miranda, a world at the far edge of the
system. Thirty million people settle there, and the Alliance mixes a chemical
called the Pax into the air processors in an effort to curb aggression. The
chemical is too effective, with the majority of the population becoming so
passive that they eventually die. However, a tenth of one percent of the
population have the opposite reaction, becoming uncontrollably violent. The
central planets of the Core which form the Anglo-Sino Alliance decide that all
of the settled planets have to join under their rule. There is some
disagreement on that point. As a result, the Alliance wages the War to Unite
the Planets (or Unification War) to bring those planets under their rule,
fighting against the Independent Faction, also known as Browncoats.

2511 -- Late March -- The Battle of Serenity Valley is fought on Hera. It is
among the most devastating and decisive battles of the war, as the valley is
considered a key position by both sides, and it is bitterly fought over. The
Alliance says they are going to waltz through the valley, but the Independent
Faction, with sixteen brigades and twenty air-tank squads, do not make victory
easy for them, holding the valley against Alliance forces for almost two months.

2511 -- Mid-May -- Superior numbers and a brilliant deep-flank strategy by
General Richard Wilkins begin to turn the tide at Serenity Valley in the
Alliance's favour.

2511 -- Unification Day (Late May) -- After a week of negotiations, a peace
agreement is reached, with the Independents surrendering to Alliance forces.
All of the settled worlds are united as a result of the peace agreement
and the Anglo-Sino Alliance, which had originally formed on Earth-That-Was,
comes to be formally known as the Union of Allied Planets. It is considered by
some to be the dawn of a new galaxy.

==============================================================================

RP FIRST
==============================================================================
This site is dedicated to the idea that RP comes first -and- character
development and the story is paramount. We are here to RP, end of story. Every
in-character action adds to the game. Just because person X is attacking you
ICly doesn't mean that they don't like you OOCly and the staff on
Serenity MUSH will not tolerate petty OOC fighting. We will make every effort
to make this a fun place to play for everyone.

If you are unwilling to accept this basic truth, please find somewhere else
to play. The Admin simply will not accept anything less from our players. This
is an RP-based MUSH. That being said, in-character actions will still equal to
in-character consequences.

Too many people who MUSH believe that character development means two things,
a promotion to a higher rank or the next skill level. In an effort to change
that belief the Admin and Staff will be driving real character development
and offer ideas on how you can change and grow. Your background and family
are ours in terms of the story. Use them to set up your character, and then
use that set of circumstances to drive your character to the next level in the
story, not for your character's ego.
==============================================================================

RIVER: Has killed the database with her brain!
ALTS
==============================================================================

If a player has held a character for at least two months time on the MUSH,
they may request to play a second character (an alt). A second character may
be a regular PC or a restricted, applied for character such as Alliance, a
Noble or a Feature Character.

Alts cannot be taken for opposing factions or orgs for obviously conflicting
purposes. Alts can also not be within the same org. Likewise, alts should not
be put into a position where they are interacting in scenes together (this
includes being in the same room together), assisting one another, sharing
information, items or any other circumstances of this nature. This includes
sending players from your org to RP with your alt and/or org.

If you find yourself needing to move through a room in which your alt is in in
order to get to a different room, you may not stay to RP out moving through the
room. Politely state OOCly that you're sorry but you cannot stay and RP and
must 'speedwalk' through. If people in that room wish to RP with you, they can
follow you to the next room or to your destination. Reason for this is because
it generally takes several poses to 'walk past' and during that time, both
characters would become privy to the same information.

We understand that sometimes it can be hard to get a feel for ones character
or didn't have certain information prior to creating the character in the first
place, so we allow players to return to chargen, rename themselves and start
over again. However, because the process can be tedious and because the
process leaves other characters in limbo, we only allow players to regen (be
placed back in chargen to 'do over') 3 times. After the third time, the player
will no longer be allowed to play an alt and only be able to play the one
character of their choice.

Alts are a privilege granted to players who have already made valuable
contributions toward bettering the game in their roleplay, however any breach
of the rules can and may result in the admin revoking the alt. The admin
reserve the right to change or alter rules at staff discretion.

*** All Alt characters and their concepts MUST be approved, via the +ALTREQ
command (+help +altreq), before they are created. ***

Note: As of May 22, 2007 the policy of only 2 characters (1 primary & 1 alt)
per player is fully enforced. Any player who exceeds this limit prior to the
above mentioned date will be granted an exception up until such time as any
character under their control dies or there is a request to regen at which
point they will be required to forsake the character if they are still in
excess of 2 characters. If an alt exceeding the limit of 2 is inactive for
more than 60 days and the player is not on a leave of absence, the admin
reserves the right to remove that character from the grid.

RATING
==============================================================================
We, the admin, have decided to rate this MUSH as M (Mature) rating, however some
scenes may be rated R. The admin do not screen players and it is the player's
responsibility to know what is appropriate for your own age. The official
ratings can be viewed at http://www.filmratings.com

What does that mean to you?

If you are under the age of 13 you shouldn't play here. We are trying to build
a story to show a more realistic side of Firefly and story development. Bad
things happen in the real world, people say bad things, do bad things and the
like. If you're over 13 what does that mean to you? If you're over 13 and would
like to play here and the RP turns to a more adult theme it is your responsibly
to bow out of the RP. Because the admin has no way of confirming a player's age,
if you choose to participate in an RP scene that you know would be rated R,
and/or inappropriate for your age you waive all our liability for any adult
content that may be contained in said RP.

PLAYER RULES
==============================================================================

You shall refrain from using excessive vulgarities anywhere, either on
channels or OOCly, or IC in poses or says. If you are found to use them
excessively in the eyes of the admin, you will be warned and asked to refrain
from further excessive vulgarities. Further excessive use of vulgarities will
result in various punishments.

Prejudicial slurs, phrases, comments or innuendo will NOT be tolerated OOCly,
Period.  ICly they will be kept to a minimum. If you are caught "bashing"
someone OOCly, or if it is too vulgar or too much, you will be dealt with
swiftly.  Harassment of anyone OOCly will not be tolerated either.

Abuse of code (Server-side or Game-side) will NOT be tolerated.  If you find a
bug, loophole, typo, or anything else of the sort, report it to the admin, as
usually they will reward you for your assistance. Anyone found abusing code
will be simply @nuked and @sitelocked, and depending on extent of abuse,
report to their ISP as well as the authorities.

PLAYER RULES2
==============================================================================
The admin's word is final.  You may discuss politely with the admin their
decision, but if they have made a final decision, that is the end of
discussion.  If you have an issue with the decision of an admin, contact the
Gamemaster/Mal who will make the final discussion. However, in most cases the
judgment of the first admin will be held firm unless deemed unfair in some
way.  If you become obnoxious, mean or anything of the sort, you will be
punished for your actions. The admin are here to make your MUSHing experience
better, and they are not out to get you.

Any scene in which you do not wish to take part, it may be "faded to black"
for yourself, however the results will still occur. (I.e.:- You don't want
to play out your execution or play out things that would make you so upset
that you don't want take part in the scene) will be completed by an admin on
behalf of you, and you will be told the result.  Sometimes a "fade to black"
will be given by an admin on a whole scene, because playing out the scene is
proving to be a problem for the players, in which case the results will be
let known to all of those who were involved.

If any of the rules are broken above, the admin retain the right to apply
an appropriate punishment for someone who breaks the rules.

ROLEPLAY RULES
==============================================================================
Roleplaying on the whole is straightforward. Use your common sense, and you
should do fine. However, here are some good things to know, and some rules to
follow when roleplaying.

Keep IC (In Character) knowledge (The information you learn through IC means.)
and OOC (Out of Character) information (the information you learn through
non-IC means) separate.  Do not use OOC information ICly.  RP would have to be
reversed if RP is found to have originated on OOC information.

In your poses, do not place the actions or reactions of other players into
your pose, including feelings, reactions, and so forth. Do not assume the
reaction of the other players as well. Allow the other player to react to
your own actions.

As the consent rules state, IC actions have IC consequences. Keep this in
mind, whenever you do something.  There are many possible consequences,
including brig time, dismemberment, loss of belongings, and/or death. All
poses and actions should stay in theme. Anything that might alter the whole
theme of the MUSH, or alter something large, MUST be approved by admin.
==============================================================================

ADMIN RULES
==============================================================================
The admin reserve the right to monitor anything that goes on within the MUSH
or related to it on the server on which it is hosted, using any means the
admin wish.  The admin also reserve the right to log anything they deem
necessary upon the MUSH. We do this to protect the interests of others and
the interests of the MUSH, so we can investigate and handle any potentially
harmful or rule-breaking actions upon the MUSH, and to help enhance RP
upon the MUSH.

The admin will be fair in their judgment and fair with their power, and they
will try to listen to any player's concerns and assist as best they can. If
they can not assist or be fair, they will refer the player to an admin that
can help.

Continued in 'news admin rules2'
==============================================================================

ADMIN RULES2
==============================================================================
The admin reserve the right to reverse any RP, and any RP that is a result of
the initial RP, that is deemed OOC in nature, such as OOC acquisition of
knowledge and use of that knowledge ICly, RP that is not in theme with the
MUSH, RP that was not fairly run by another admin, or harmful to the MUSH
and/or its timeline.

Admin will apply punishments as deemed necessary for actions that are
considered appropriate for the action, and will have other admin notified of
situation. Any more severe punishments will include The Gamemaster's knowledge
and consent in the matter as well.

==============================================================================

CHANNELS
==============================================================================

There are several channels for players to join on the game. However, before
jumping into any conversation on any channel, please follow the following
guidelines.

Channels that are colored with yellow are for newbies, helpers,
or game related discussion.

Channels that are colored bright green are informational use.

Channels that are colored bright aqua are for all to use.

Channels that are colored dark red and publicly visible are Noble channels.

Channels that are colored blue are ship channels.

Channels that are colored purple are org channels.

Channels that are bright red are Alliance and Government channels.

Channels that are grey are underworld and criminal channels.

Channels that are colored with cyan are for staff only.

Please understand that there are certain channels for use about controversial
subjects. These include Religion, Politics, and others. These subjects should
be limited to these channels only. Also, these channels are for constructive
conversations. Hatred, and ignorance will not be tolerated, nor will any name
calling at all.

The Public and Newbie channels are to be considered PG-13 at all times. This
is because we cannot guarantee that guests are 17+, and so, we must ensure
we keep a proper rating on the channels. This is a very strict guideline.

Violation of these guidelines will be dealt with by staff as needed.

==============================================================================

AGE
==============================================================================
Serenity MUSH follows a strict policy when it comes to age. Our game is set
in a universe that allows for adult scenes, innuendos, and other such things.
So, we rate our game as Mature, meaning 17+. Our stipulation is that you must
be 18 years old in order to play.

However, when it comes to roleplaying sex, only players who are 18 years of
age or older can roleplay out sexual scenes. This means that if you are under
the age of 18, and you are caught roleplaying out a sexual scene, which is
defined as anything more then kissing (Which means no groping or other stuff)
then you will be disciplined as follows;

1st Time:    You will be given a warning, and commented.

2nd Time:    You will be banned from the game for 30 days.

3rd Time:    You will be banned from the game until you turn 18.

If we find out you have lied about your age, you will be banned from the game
for life, no matter if we find out and you have not been having mature scenes,
or not. So please, follow these rules. They are here to protect you, and
us, from getting into legal trouble.

SEX POLICY (TS)                                                      Page 1
==============================================================================
Serenity MUSH /is/ listed as a Sexually-Oriented Material Game, when you think
of the show and movie, Joss didn't really leave a whole lot to the imagination
when showing us what Inara did for a living. Both a Whore House as well as the
infamous Companions Guild meaning that there is always at some point the
chance of a sexual type of encounter.

Because of this the following rules have been put in place and are NOT
negotiable.

One: If your IC age is under 18, or you as a player are not an adult, then TS
RP should /not/ happen. End of discussion PERIOD. Once you and/or your
character have an 18th birthday you can do as you like, but not til that
time, for we at this mush do have limits on the type of interaction we think
is proper for the player base at large.

Now you may ask yourself, does underage sex happen? Of course it does in real
life, just not on this server. Breaking either of these rules leaves such
options as introducing you to the @siteban code.

Now going along with this, there are other such things you should think about
as a player. If you are finding that perfect moment with your partner
obviously there are some places that some things are just not kosher to be
done in.

Two: Don't have sex outside in public areas. If you can see Sky its probably
better to assume no unless YOU personally own the property and you have a
lock. As with anything we enjoy there are limits, and for everyones enjoyment
factor, this is one of them. And again its non-negotiable.
=======================================================[SEE: SEX2]============

SEX2
==============================================================================
RAPE POLICY ----------------------------------------- SEX POLICY (TS) Page 2
==============================================================================
RAPE POLICY

The policy on this particular concept is simple. Though we as a staff base try
to strive to have some things as realistic as possible, this is not one of
them.

The use of Rape as a story telling tool is to be removed from any and all
thought on this game whatso ever. Meaning if you as a player wish to run a TP
for bringing in a lil excitement to the rp. Thats fine! Go for it! But rape of
ANY kind is not an option. There will be no touching, no molestation, no rape
of any sort allowed on this game.

This policy has been put in place for a variety of reasons. Main one being
that, we strive very hard to maintain a certain spirit and pride on the game
to have a certain quality of RP. RP that is as non-offensive as possible to
players as a whole. Whether or not two people consent to molestation and/or
rape OOCly but not ICly does not save one from this policy as the RP itself
will trigger RP in motion that will then involve other players, players who do
not want to be subjected to such sensitive RP. Any trespass of this policy
will be met with a very quick and very strict permanent banning.

Having Rape in your background, is grounds of almost instant denial of your
background. Again there is no room for argument on this subject.

Talking about Rape in any way ICly is grounds for being immediately
@sitelocked from the game.

Now you may point out that in RL Rape does happen, and it does. However, in no
way shape form or hinting will it happen on this mush.

DEATH
==============================================================================
PC DEATH : POSITIVE POINTS                                          Page 1
==============================================================================
PC death, though not pleasant to have to go through, is something that in
time is inevitable. Whether by something of your own doing, being in the
wrong place at the wrong time, or simply the way things happened. When a
player loses a character it's very hard not to get emotionally responsive at
times. However, when a player shows self-control and restraint to take things
in stride, as well as being willing to accept what may come, there can be
rewards for such behavior.

Now when rewards is mentioned, it isn't that you'll be given something for
nothing. No, what it does mean is that you will be able to keep all of the
XP that you have on that character and use it on your next depending on the
circumstances. If you wish to just give up on your character and send it
through chargen again, commit suicide or purposely place your character in a
situation in which will cause death to your character then you will not be able
to retain your XP. However, if your character finds itself in a situation beyond
your control and dies as a result, then provided that you behave appropriately
during the process then you'll be able to keep the XP that you earned in that
life. This means that though you may want to rant, rave and generally start
griping, when you hold your emotions in check and vent them in a way thats
much more beneficial, you're much more likely to be positively rewarded.

For explanation on what the consent ruling for PC deaths is please refer
to 'news consent'
=================================================[See: DEATH2]================

CONSENT
==============================================================================
Consent on the game is not quite as simple as most people think. Unlike many
games, we do not simply define ourselves as non-consent. However, for the sake
of simplicity, we are a non-consent MUSH. This means that although you might
not agree with what is happening to your character, or in a situation, if it
is in character, then it remains. Also, because of that, we do not do retcons,
except under the most dire of circumstances such as an NPC mix up. This means
that  we do not undo most situations that occur, however we will help come
up with a way to fix repercussions if necessary.

That being said, our policy changes when you look at death. We do not promote
or encourage character death, however it does happen. We will do everything we
can in order to prevent a character from dying, including permanent injuries
and other things. That being said, death does happen and if it cannot be
prevented, or we the staff feel that it is time for your character to die
then it will occur.

HELPERS
==============================================================================
Helpers on Serenity MUSH are players who have volunteered to help new players
get acclimated to the game. Their duties are:

* Monitoring the Newbie channel.
* Greeting guests and new players.
* Answering questions about character generation and the game in general.
* Sending up +requests for documentation additions or changes as identified.

Helpers are expected to be cordial, friendly and respectful in their
interactions with all players, staff and each other.

See +HELP HELPERS for Helper-related commands.
==============================================================================
NOMS
==============================================================================
+Nominations are a useful tool for you to recognize people who excel at
roleplaying upon the MUSH.  It is meant only to reward those who you have
witnessed roleplaying, either through logs or in-person, roleplaying in an
'in-character' means.  We felt we should give some general rules and
guidelines for +Nomming, to make your experience, and those whom you +nom,
a pleasant experience. We want you to feel like it is a worthwhile time to
honor other's RP, so for each +nom you give out, you will receive a small
amount of XP yourself for each approved +nom.

    Rules:
1.  You can not +nom yourself or any of your alts. You will get a good
slap on the hands for trying to sneak this past.

2.  You can only +nom a person who has successfully completed
CharGen. You can not +nom admin. If you want to reward them, post a
flattering post on the OOC board.

3.  You can only +nom a person once in a time period. A typical time
period is 1 week.

4.  You have a limited number of +noms to give out per week.

5.  You MUST +nom for RP. You should not be +nomming because you're
buddy-buddy, or part of a +nom-swapping group. People caught doing this
will have their +nom logs reviewed, and XP will be deducted. Other
penalties may apply as well, depending on the severity.

Continued in 'news noms2'
==============================================================================

NOMS2
==============================================================================
Fairly simple rules.  Along with the rules, there are some general things
Admin will be looking for when they are reviewing +noms.  They are as
follows:

1.  We want to see proper English. Speaking in Trog, shorthand, or any
other bizarre forms will result in the dismissal of a +nom. (For those
whose English skills may not be tip-top, don't worry. :)

2.  We want to see a -->brief<-- synopsis of the RP between you and the
other person, or if you were witnessing the scene, what the person was
doing. Please, no quotes. We want to see what -->YOU<-- saw in the scene.

3.  We want to see why the scene touched you. It doesn't have to go into
extreme details, but we do want to know why you liked the scene, in your
-->OWN<-- words.

4.  We DON'T want huge +noms.  There is a minimum hardcoded limit, but we
also don't want to see novels coming through the +nom system.

When your +nom is approved, you both will be awarded your XP, and your
+nom will be logged in the system.  These +noms can help admin make
decisions in the future on such things as awarding Feature Characters
or other aspects.

For an example +nom, see 'news noms3'
==============================================================================

NOMS3
==============================================================================
Here is an example of a +nomination:

+nom Joe Bitzlplix=Joe and I had a great RP session the other night.  He
tore the brig up, he was wild to interrogate. He made it feel so
realistic, interrogating him. He made you feel like you were really
interrogating someone for something important.  This gave me the drive to
strive harder, interrogate harder, to break him down! I loved it!

Note that the key points that we are looking for were easily met in this
+nomination

There are cargo containers stacked in high hills throughout the area, most of them likely from a shop of the same name, Cargo Containers and a shadowed doorway nestled in the maze of stacks leads to Black Rose Body Art.

        Running the length of the port the side of a building boasts an entrance with an awning leading into the Steel Dragon Shipyard. To the northeast, a section between two landing platforms begins the road to the Spacer's District, where those who are less restricted to Eavesdown may find additional business options. Lower end housing is located to the east at the Eavesdown Heights while the same thoroughfare stretches to the west towards the Racetrack.

It is about 10-11:00 PM on February 14th, 2537 and there's a somber feel to the docks. Its dark, and yet every house, shop, and etc...seems to be lit with some type of red candle in the windows and such. Lined up along the dirty streets are blankets and chairs or turned over crates...etc, where people are settled down with loved ones or friends. Its not quite though, not by a long shot. Some people have their ship-part grills set up. Alcohol is shared, many with gold labels wrapped around the bottles.

The Hope House is here, well...volunteers are. They are all dressed in white and purple instead of the usual black and purple, just for visibility in the lighting. They hand out clean bottles of water to people gathered together and they also hand out red candles, lighting them for people who need it.

Towards the center of the docks, is built a small platform with a podium and in front of it, a rather LARGE something or another, covered with a dark cloth. Multiple locations have piles of teddy bears or flowers. And there are many Alliance people wandering around however...most have their hats off when passing by various piles of things left in memorials of loved/dead ones.

Katherine
        Katherine stands at the rather short height of 5'2". Her figure is slender from top to bottom, and it's likely that she weighs just a little more than 100 pounds. Her eyes are a deep blue, and seem to constantly be on the move, taking in her surroundings. Her hair is a golden blonde; kept cut just a little longer than shoulder length, though presently pulled out of the way in a ponytail. Her skin is on the pale side, obviously not someone who spends much of her time outside.
        Presently, her legs are covered with a pair of black pants which cling tightly to her hips before descending a bit more loosely along her legs. A black belt with a silver buckle secures them around her waist. A rather plain crimson top is tucked into the pants, slightly stretched across her small chest. Over the shirt she wears a black jacket, which she hasn't bothered to zip up.

Coyote(#22451PACF)
Coyote is a thin young man of average height. His light brown hair is shaggy and untrimmed, sticking out at strange angles. He looks out at the world through a pair of round spectacles. His right eye is brown, but his left eye is blue. He usually has a thin layer of stubble, unless today is one of the days that he has remembered to shave in the morning. He wears a light grey suit that might have once been nice before filtering through various friends, relations, and thrift stores. He is usually holding a PDA in his right hand. His boots are scuffed and worn. A battered black bowler hat attempts to perch on his head.

        This large dumpster has 'smart paper' laminated on the front that acts like a billboard flashing changing advertisements in 2 dimensions.

        Right now the advertisement is for:

      _.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._

                            Camdon Engineering Ltd                            

                When you can't afford downtime make it Camdon!

Lone Wolf

        A low sleek craft, this vessel is little more than a large engine with fuel tank, wings, and a cockpit. There is a hatch on the side leading into the aft bay and from there, to the cockpit, but as small as the vessel is, there is little room for luxuries or living space.
        Painted flat black, this craft would probably be easily lost in space, the hull is smooth and heavily armoured for it's size, and fairly bristles with weapons, sensor probes, and a variety of antennas. There is nothing on the craft to indicate it's designation, save for a string of numbers stencilled beneath the cockpit viewscreen.

Redemption

        This Trans-U was once used as a cruise liner, but it's obvious that this ship has been modified by her owner with other uses in mind. Sleek and beautiful, her fuselage is vaguely shark-shaped, without the dorsal fins. Built for comfort and a smooth ride, stabilizers protrude from various points from the aft on the ship, giving her a predatorial look.

        She's been painted in dark tones: black being her primary color, with deep blood red accents along the fuselage and along the wingtips and fins, giving her a simple metallic finish and a low visibility profile when her lights are off. On either side of her is painted her symbol, the Lion Guardant Rampant, underneath which is written in red, 'REDEMPTION'.

        From nose to tail, she's 263 feet long, with large armored viewports giving glimpses into the decadent wooden interior, decorated like an old Earth-that-Was ship. Her wingspan is 162 feet, and she stands 80 feet proud, with the Bridge being the highest and foremost point with a 180-degree vantage point viewport.

        When in port, she emanates a soft and welcoming glow from her viewports, almost beckoning to weary travelers and weathered Spacers alike. It's said that her Captain is always welcoming to anyone requesting a hot meal, comfortable bed, or congenial conversation and company.

***All around the 'verse, with special emphasis on the Rim and Border worlds, there has begun to appear tracts and pamphlets espousing the idea of freedom from the tyranny of the Alliance, and questioning the influence of Blue Sun over the leadership of the 'verse.*** 

         The Freedom Movement is looking for people willing to fight for their rights. It needs people from all walks of life, with all types of skills, and a desire to make a difference. We have no illusions about the difficulty of our task, or the realities of our chances, but every action taken in Resistance, no matter how small, is one step closer to Freedom. 


 OOC: Contact Rodney, if you are interested in information on joining the Freedom Movement. There is lots of room for exciting plots, both overt and covert, and in a more political vein, as well.

Looking for a couple able-bodied people to come and keep this ship flying in two different ways. Looking for an Engineer to keep her fixed and a Pilot to keep her going. Must have a soft spot for degenerates, a thumb up at the Alliance, and a passion to follow wherever you're told to go. We're on a mission, are you up for the challenge?

  Eavesdown Docks - Persephone                                  =>Persephone<=
==============================================================================
        This lesser kept portion of Persephone's port city is home to legions of disenfranchised entrepreneurs, each tent or stall vying with the next in line. Vendors shout their own particular brand of advertisements or allow the pyres of smoke from their grills to do the advertising for them while others are busy buying and selling goods of every imaginable value. There are cargo containers stacked in high hills throughout the area, most of them likely from a shop of the same name, Cargo Containers and a shadowed doorway nestled in the maze of stacks leads to Black Rose Body Art.

        Running the length of the port the side of a building boasts an entrance with an awning leading into the Steel Dragon Shipyard. To the northeast, a section between two landing platforms begins the road to the Spacer's District, where those who are less restricted to Eavesdown may find additional business options. Lower end housing is located to the east at the Eavesdown Heights while the same thoroughfare stretches to the west towards the Racetrack.

==============================================================================

        Nestled between the Eavesdown Docks to the southwest and the City Commons to the northeast, this cluster of businesses is just one step away from the Eavesdown Heights that lie directly south. Food and drink can be found in The Dregs Bar and Grill or The Captain's Retreat though for temporary sleeping arrangements there's only one choice in this part of town, Largo's Crate Motel.

        A Dark Alley off to the west seems a sinister counterpart to the apartments that rise up in the opposite direction, The Eavesdown Flats, and almost in the center of it all sits the Derrial Book Memorial Hospital.

==============================================================================

        The city Commons of Persephone is not only the best shopping in the city, it's also the main connector between the City Center to the Northeast and the area called Eavesdown Docks, the slums of the planet, that can be found further to the Southwest beyond the Spacers District. All around people take elevators or skywalks to various parts of the Commons, most of them in business attire or a uniform of one kind or another.

        Shops of every kind can be found around the area, including Quick Draw Outfitters which lies a bit to the south. Carts roll the streets and fancy window models for some of the higher end product keep the area thrumming with activity giving the commons a busy atmosphere, even during off hours. Located directly to the North of the area is the Persephone Spaceport, that pathway leading directly past the Marshal's Office and Cargo Office.

==============================================================================

        Located north of the Commons, the Persephone Spaceport is a hustle and bustle of ships, cargo, and people. To say it is noisy here is an understatement with crowds of people swarming the arriving, departing, or parked ships and the near-constant shuffle of passengers to and from the shuttles. A steady stream of people flows in and out of the Cargo Office while others take the path to the Shipyard, the remainder heading south toward the city and all it has to offer. Not far into the distance an imposing skyline rises in a jagged pattern against the horizon alluding to the size of the city that lies beyond the trappings of the main entrance.

        "No Poofs," reads the big sign just inside the doorway to the Street, and the general decor of the Dregs backs up that assertion. Grim faced spacers sit on battered wooden chairs at equally battered tables or stand at the bar eating sandwiches and drinking and laughing and cussing. The long bar is rimmed with brass fittings, dented and pockmarked and worn from years of elbows and dirty hands. The mahagony surface of the bar is well polished and waxed. There are no bar stools, but despite this lack patrons belly up to the bar and vie for position with eachother at all hours, and at any given moment a fight is likely to break out. Behind the gruff looking bartender a large sign proclaims, "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. That means you, fancy-pants!"
         Small wooden tables are scattered haphazardly about the center of the room, each surrounded by a small cluster of chairs, none of them new. Booths line the walls and offer a modicum of privacy for those who desire or require such. The table in the corner to the right of the door as one faces the bar has a card game going, and the rumor around town is that that same game has been going on, with rotating players, for over a year non-stop.

The Dregs...has seen better days, but its been decently renovated lately. It now has a patio where the front of the bar used to be, covered by a series of metal slabs and tarps. Sturdy Wooden Furniture and a central table where people are playing cards or dominos or a combination of both. The inside of the bar is smaller than it used to be, bar perfectly in tact has there are more tables scattered about, folks drinking (heavily) and eating (riskily) that which is available but its still active, loud voices and laughter and ribald songs. There's a more sober feel to the Dregs these days as its become a place where the Dregs of society go for a decent non Alliance inspected meal and some high quality booze for low low prices. Also there's people selling their wares in corners or at tables, just trying to get by.

Shaun

         Standing to the tall height of 6'2", is Shaun Erentin. Jet black hair is kept buzz-cut short, long enough just to show he was not yet bald, nor gray. Dark emerald green eyes gleam out from the rather scared face, the most noteable of which running from left cheek, up and over his average nose and stopping just before his right temple. Pale pink lips are often held straight, and from the lack of lines at his cheek rarely curled into a smile. Covering his wide chin and jaw is a generous beard, which appears to be nearly two to three inches in length. 

         Currently, Shaun has decided to go with a dressed down look. His well defined upper body is only contained by a simple gray tank top. This lack of cloth allowed the many scars that scrawled over his arms to be seen. From the look, the scars came from various reason, be it shots, cuts or beastly scratches. The tank top dropped lightly around his waist, which held a pair of well worn jeans. The jeans, like the tank top were a bit loose, but still told all to well that he was well rounded in his build. Finishing off the outfit was a pair of jet black combat boots, which looked like they had seen many a mile already.

Mack
Mid-lenght dark hair is pulled back in a tight ponytail, displaying her widow's peak and revealing her strong features. Her eyes are dark brown and intense in expression, brows just slightly arched and beneath a straight nose, a full, unsmiling mouth. She is somewhere around 5'6 and while femininely curved, her figure would be described as athletic, lean muscle evident in the way she carries herself.
She is sharply dressed in black slacks and a black blouse, her shoes of course, black with low heels. A messenger's bag is slung across her body, the strap sometimes obscuring the badge at her hip and the gun at her back.

==============================================================================

        There are three main attractions of The Captain's Retreat: The bar, the food, and the stage. The bar is long, covering an entire wall of the establishment, and made of solid oak. Along the wall behind the bar, there are numerous bottles of various types of alcohol, as well as a good supply of glasses in all shapes and sizes. The front of the bar is lined with comfortable bar stools, giving patrons somewhere to sit while they drink. Another corner of the establishment is filled by a large stage, set about half a metre above the ground. In the remaining corner is the entrance from the Spacer's District, usually staffed by a security guard who makes sure that all patrons check their weapons before they enter the establishment proper.

        Set beneath a high ceiling of oak panels carved with various nautical scenes, the remainder of the bar is filled by a series of round tables. Each table seats two to six patrons and busy servers keep the door to the Kitchen swinging while seeing to all their customer's needs. One wall houses a series of booths, each set with comfortable seats and a table, separated by high walls. A red curtain can be drawn closed across the entrance to the booth for privacy, or kept open for a view of the rest of the bar.

CHANNELS()
  channels([<delimiter>])
  channels(<object>)
  channels(<object>[,<delimiter>])
 
  With no arguments, channels() returns the list of all channel names
  which are visible to the player. With two arguments, returns the list
  of channel names to which the object is listening, delimited by
  <delimiter>.
 
  With one argument, the behavior is ambiguous. If the argument
  matches an object, returns the list of names to which the object
  is listening, space-delimited. If not, it's treated as a no-argument
  case with a delimiter.
 
  If you don't have permission to examine the object, you only see 
  those channels to which the object belong for which you have 
  permission to join (or are joined to).

CHAT
  CHAT SYSTEM
 
  The MUSH has a built-in chat system with many different channels.
  These channels vary from MUSH to MUSH; ask at your local site or
  use @channel/list to see which ones are available.
 
  You can talk to many people on the MUSH via the chat system, without
  needing to be in the same room as them. Use the "@channel" command
  to join, leave, or check who is on a channel, and use the "@chat"
  or "+" command to communicate.
 
  If you examine yourself, you will see a list of channels that you are
  currently listening to. Some channels are restricted to wizards or
  administrators only. See the following help topics for details:
    @chat, @channel, @cemit, @clock, cwho()

  The Captain's Retreat - Persephone                            =>Persephone<=
==============================================================================

        There are three main attractions of The Captain's Retreat: The bar, the food, and the stage. The bar is long, covering an entire wall of the establishment, and made of solid oak. Along the wall behind the bar, there are numerous bottles of various types of alcohol, as well as a good supply of glasses in all shapes and sizes. The front of the bar is lined with comfortable bar stools, giving patrons somewhere to sit while they drink. Another corner of the establishment is filled by a large stage, set about half a metre above the ground. In the remaining corner is the entrance from the Spacer's District, usually staffed by a security guard who makes sure that all patrons check their weapons before they enter the establishment proper.

        Set beneath a high ceiling of oak panels carved with various nautical scenes, the remainder of the bar is filled by a series of round tables. Each table seats two to six patrons and busy servers keep the door to the Kitchen swinging while seeing to all their customer's needs. One wall houses a series of booths, each set with comfortable seats and a table, separated by high walls. A red curtain can be drawn closed across the entrance to the booth for privacy, or kept open for a view of the rest of the bar.

  The Captain's Retreat - Persephone                            =>Persephone<=
==============================================================================

        There are three main attractions of The Captain's Retreat: The bar, the food, and the stage. The bar is long, covering an entire wall of the establishment, and made of solid oak. Along the wall behind the bar, there are numerous bottles of various types of alcohol, as well as a good supply of glasses in all shapes and sizes. The front of the bar is lined with comfortable bar stools, giving patrons somewhere to sit while they drink. Another corner of the establishment is filled by a large stage, set about half a metre above the ground. In the remaining corner is the entrance from the Spacer's District, usually staffed by a security guard who makes sure that all patrons check their weapons before they enter the establishment proper.

        Set beneath a high ceiling of oak panels carved with various nautical scenes, the remainder of the bar is filled by a series of round tables. Each table seats two to six patrons and busy servers keep the door to the Kitchen swinging while seeing to all their customer's needs. One wall houses a series of booths, each set with comfortable seats and a table, separated by high walls. A red curtain can be drawn closed across the entrance to the booth for privacy, or kept open for a view of the rest of the bar.

WHERE()
  where(<object>)

  This function returns the "true" location of an object. This is
  the standard location (i.e. where the object is) for things and
  players, the source room for exits, and #-1 for rooms.

  In other words, the "true" location of an object is where it is
  linked into the database. For example, an exit appears in the
  room of its "home", not its "location" (the LOC() function on an
  exit will return the latter). A room's "real" location is always
  Nothing (the LOC() function will return its drop-to).

==============================================================================

        Nestled between the Eavesdown Docks to the southwest and the City Commons to the northeast, this cluster of businesses is just one step away from the Eavesdown Heights that lie directly south. Food and drink can be found in The Dregs Bar and Grill or The Captain's Retreat though for temporary sleeping arrangements there's only one choice in this part of town, Largo's Crate Motel.

        A Dark Alley off to the west seems a sinister counterpart to the apartments that rise up in the opposite direction, The Eavesdown Flats, and almost in the center of it all sits the Derrial Book Memorial Hospital.

==============================================================================
        This lesser kept portion of Persephone's port city is home to legions of disenfranchised entrepreneurs, each tent or stall vying with the next in line. Vendors shout their own particular brand of advertisements or allow the pyres of smoke from their grills to do the advertising for them while others are busy buying and selling goods of every imaginable value. There are cargo containers stacked in high hills throughout the area, most of them likely from a shop of the same name, Cargo Containers and a shadowed doorway nestled in the maze of stacks leads to Black Rose Body Art.

        Running the length of the port the side of a building boasts an entrance with an awning leading into the Steel Dragon Shipyard. To the northeast, a section between two landing platforms begins the road to the Spacer's District, where those who are less restricted to Eavesdown may find additional business options. Lower end housing is located to the east at the Eavesdown Heights while the same thoroughfare stretches to the west towards the Racetrack.

==============================================================================
        Comprised of stacked and overlaid shipping containers, plywood, garish decorations, and greedy dreams, this little corner of Eavesdown has been turned into the command post and office of one "Badger". Faded carpets cover the dirt below while a fan above casts a circling shadow upon those beneath. A desk, a few chairs... all of which have seen better days give the place a certain sense of broken style.

Ivan gives Coyote a glancing look as he enters.
Ivan Grigorwich

        This fellow looks rather like a walking wardrobe then a human being. He's nearly as broad as he's long which at his 6' something is quite an amount. His head is clean shaved, only the small dark brown beard, a circle around his tight, hard lips, and the eyebrows can be seen, the rest seems to be polished to shine. Wearing black slacks, fairly formally looking ones at that, his form and bulging muscles are barely kept in check by it. Adding to that, the white shirt and black tie make him look even more misplaced in the outfit, his broad shoulders nearly ripping the fabric.

==============================================================================

        One of the more famous attractions to be found around Eavesdown, the racetrack grounds are surrounded by a tall, white wooden fence. Tiered seating descends toward the center on all sides save one that houses food and betting services, private boxes and meeting rooms, all settled at the upper end of the track. Long columns of stairs climb the stands with landings provided at each tier for access to restrooms. Along the lowest row of seats a security rail separates spectators from the action, although a spray of dirt whisks in the air from stampeding hooves isn't altogether uncommon.
        Directly beside the the concession area a wide gate gives horse and rider egress to the stables and practice track. Directly across from the rider's gate on the opposite side of concessions is a row of gates stalls that open to the Eavesdown Docks to the East.

==============================================================================

        Deep in the heart of the Eavesdown, the twisted warren of winding paths, corridors and alleyways have become ordered and straight streets. To the west lies the Eavesdown Docks, visible over and around the edges of new plasticrete buildings. The north holds the Spacers District. The whole area is designed to allow light in; trees have been planted that in the last few months have begun to rise up into the air. Gone is the stench of debris, refuse and fear, supplanted and discouraged by patrolling local security personnel hired by the Alliance and the occasional Interpol patrol. Where there was once no traffic, vehicles travel along the ordered streets. Gone are the skin trade vendors, the back alley arms dealers and the ladies (and lads) of the night. The Alliance - along with corporate donors - renovated this area to encourage small local businesses to take root and flourish. Tattoo parlors, vehicle repair shops, a blacksmith, small armorsmiths and mom and pop diners and grocery stores have taken the place of shady dice joints and bars where the beer is as valued as your life. The homes are pre-fab but sturdy, with small backyards. The entire area is designed as an open, plaza architecture. While it's not as well to do as other areas of Persephone, people here live comfortable lives, without worrying about wandering through the streets at night for the most part. What was once the Eavesdown Slums is now the Eavesdown Heights.

==============================================================================

        This once scum-ridden no-frills barebones no-tell hotel/apartment complex has been rebuilt since the pirate-riots of 2528. In its place, the Alliance (along with corporate assistance) has built a thirty story low-rent apartment building. Still basic, it uses rented security for law enforcement, but where once the windows were dirty (or boarded over) and the floors disgusting, this has all been replaced with pre-fab treated wood and plasticrete walls. The doors use an electronic key to get in, and the first floor has a window-surrounded entry way and a small cafe in the atrium. The rooms are simple - one room to three depending on your price range, and they still offer daily (but not hourly) rates. The views are definitely better, looking out over the Eavesdown Heights with its clean lines and still-new smell. The cheap tile has been replaced with manufacturered wood flooring, and the mission statement has changed as well: 'Comfortable living for a comfortable price.' The roof has a built in garden for the cafe itself, and an area for residents to sun themselves or look out over the horizon.

  Eavesdown Digs - Stairwell - Persephone                       =>Persephone<=
==============================================================================

        A simple winding stairwell with landings at every floor and at the half-way points where the stairs make a one hundred and eighty degree turn, the walls are a simple light beige plasticrete material. At the first turning, halfway to the Second Floor Hallway there is a call button for the front desk. The stairwell smells of clean, recycled air.

==============================================================================

        This simple hallway is covered in beige plasticrete, with manufactured wooden flooring. The air smells cleanly of recycled air. The doors are painted in light pastel colors, fresh black paint denotes directions, with electronic signs for each resident's name (or 'Anonymous' for those that wish it.) Subdued simple lighting helps frame the hallway, with windows here and there to let in the view from the Eavesdown Heights area.
