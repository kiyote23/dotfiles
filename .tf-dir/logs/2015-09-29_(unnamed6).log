--- << Theme >> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The Penultimate Destination setting is chiefly centered around the lands of Empyrea, floating in the Great Void. No one is exactly certain what the Great Void is, with theories ranging from a gap in spacetime between worlds, to an unformed world that seeks out something to define itself with. In the end, the only thing that matters is this: people and things tend to slip between the 'cracks' of their own worlds and fall into the Great Void, and getting out is difficult. Getting out to where you want to go is much, much more difficult.

        The earliest arrivals had the greatest influence, as the formless Void manifest objects and even land and water from the subconscious desires and needs of those around it, but newer arrivals find their influence, individually, lessened by the presence of so many others. The First Three formed the land of Empyrea, the three siblings arriving to immediately create a sprawling landscape from their desires. The siblings were close, so some common elements helped to form the land into a somewhat cohesive whole.

        No one remembers their names, but according to tales the three could not reach an agreement on how the land and newcomers would be treated. Instead of a unified whole, they formed an uneasy accord, with each retreating to their own section of Empyrea to establish its rules as they desired. In time these rules became altered and grew, most now possessing a labyrinthine set of laws that few can fully comprehend. The spirit of the Three is intact, however.

        The three founding Regions consist of Apos, the central region which maintains a nominally 'normal' existence, which is connected to Diony, the City of Splendor, which is a much more public and hedonistic place. Finally, the vast wilderness areas are largely dominated by Cerel, holding the bulk of natural land, farmland, and rural areas.

        Despite being in a Great Void, Empyrea largely looks like a normal world, though many feel something is slightly 'off' due to the lack of curvature of the land. The stars are often different as well. For more information on the physical layout, see Cosmology.

--- << Rules >> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        By playing on this server, you agree to follow the rules. We've tried to keep these rules simple, and hopefully won't need to expand them too much. Remember that staff are not robots, and thus may have to make judgement calls. In MOST cases this means you have a means of appeal.

        RULE ZERO: No illegal stuff. This means no images that would be considered illegal in most jurisdictions such as bestiality, child pornography, etc. Distributing this sort of thing is a huge threat to us and if we find it, we'll be banning you instantly and probably reporting you to the authorities. Other things that will possibly get you banned are links to pirated software and movies, and any other copyright violations. As an extension of this, you MUST be 18 or older to play here. If it is found that you are younger than 18 years of age, you will be immediately banned.

        RULE ONE: Don't be a jerk. If you're obnoxiously aggressive to others, especially in public, or you harass others, spread inappropriate rumors, and so on, you'll quickly find yourself drawing the ire of staff. This is supposed to be a place to safely explore kinks and fetishes, and if you become aggressive in targeting other players, either personally or in groups, you make this an uncomfortable place. Keep in mind that some of your kinks may also be very squicky to some others, so avoid being overly aggressive in public venues, unless that venue specifically caters to such things(like the Hardcore Requests board)

        RULE TWO: Right to Privacy. Players may list their alts, but are not required to reveal them to anyone. Pressuring someone else to reveal their alts or personal(RL) information is a rules violation. No one, not even staff, has a right to your password, and only Royals and Wizards have access to alt lists. Note that Helpers are not considered staff. Revealing alts of other players to others is also not allowed.

        RULE THREE: Right of Refusal. No one can force you to RP with another person, in any circumstances. If you feel pressured, please report it. This includes feeling pressured by a known staff alt, or someone claiming to be staff.

        RULE FOUR: Consent. No one may affect your character without your OOC consent, and you may not force anything on another player's character without that player's consent. You may waive your consent willingly in some situations, but everyone should keep in mind that this is a cooperative environment, and respect for one another's players is an important part of keeping it a fun and safe environment. Note that staff may at times rule that something particularly lacking in common sense may result in IC penalties, but given the looseness of the theme this is highly unlikely to occur.

--- << Rules/IdleNuke >> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Penultimate Destination normally runs an idlenuke every week. During this idlenuke, old unused characters will be deleted to free up space and names for other players. Under normal conditions, any character who has not logged in for 60 days will be deleted. Any character who has been in Character Generation longer than 30 days will also be nuked.

        Players can avoid having their characters idlenuked by setting the ON-VACATION flag before any extended absences, which will extend the time period to 120 days. If a player expects to be gone for longer than that, please contact staff to make special arrangements.

        The kinks system lists the particular player's roleplay and sexual interests. While not complete, the kinks selection should provide a good idea of the various types of RP someone wants.

        To access the list of kinks, use +kinks/list. This provides a list of very general kinks which are a good starting point. Most of these kinks have more specific Subkinks, which can go into great detail and which can be seen by using +kinks/listall. This is a very large list, so you may want to limit it to a category by appending the category code like so: +kinks/listall <letter> or +kinks/list <letter>. For example, use 'R' for Roleplay kinks. To see a list of the kink categories, with their code first, use +kinks/cats

        To view the kinks on a given character, use +kinks <name> or +kinks/all <name> to see all the subkinks as well. When viewing a character's kinks, it will also list how much they like it(Fave for favorite kinks, Yes for kinks they are almost always up for, Maybe for kinks that they might do, and No for kinks that they do not want to deal with), and a letter code for how they like to have it performed: G for Giving, R for Receiving, and B for Both Receive and Give. The listing may also include a Comment. If you are not sure what a kink means, you can enter the kink code into +kinks/info <code> and receive a brief explanation. To search for the existence of a kink by description or by name, you can use the +kinks/index <string> command.

        If desired, you can use +kinks <name>/<kink> or +kinks/all <name>/<kink> to view only a single kink. This also accepts a kink category(such as R or H without a number) to list all a player's kinks in that one category.

        For more information on setting your kinks, see +help +kinks/Setting

        For more information on setting customized kinks, see +help +kinks/Custom

        For more information on searching kinks, see +help +kinks/Search

        +kinks/dump can be used to get a dump of all your kinks and comments, in order to reuse them later.

        +kinks/wipe will not actually wipe your kinks, but will output a command you can copy and paste to wipe all your kinks.

        For hints on setting kinks, see +help +kinks/Advice

--- << +kinks/Advice >> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        When setting your kinks, be careful not to go overboard and set a pref for every single kink. Not only is this time-consuming, but it's extremely spammy to those looking, and many people will quickly find that it's hard to find what you REALLY want because it's difficult to sift through all the extraneous kinks. Try setting a shorter, simpler kinks list first, and add kink prefs only as you encounter others questioning or making improper assumptions.

        In order to use search to the fullest, be sure to set your orientation for some kinks. This is especially true of preference kinks, where you can set your desired partners as 'Receive' kinks. For example, if you play exclusively with males, you can set Male: Receive and people can thus search for that, making it a far more reliable and accurate indicator than searching sex pref.

        You can also set your own @sex through kinks by using the 'Giving' orientation, but the Receive is usually more important.

        Similarly, when searching try to use the orientation flags to your advantage. Not all kinks make sense to have a Give or Receive preference, but it can help with those that do.
