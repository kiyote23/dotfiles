[Alliance Information Center]
The alliance information center is a small, oddly imposing room with three hallways running out of it. The walls are painted with a light shade of tan that seems to flow off the wall and blend seamlessly with the soft carpet beneath your feet. Above the doorway to each hall hangs a large, colorful emblem for the alliance within. A long, polished desk runs in a u-shape around the room, breaking only to allow entrance through one of the doors leading to the individual alliance information rooms. Behind the desk a number of men and women, all wearing the same style of impeccably tailored business suit, stare out into the group of new recruits, ready to help.

For help, type TALK REPRESENTATIVE.
You see a u-shaped desk, a helpful alliance representative (sitting at a u-shaped desk), and a transparent starship simulator here.
You see Edward Paden (lying on the ground) here, sleeping.
You can go north, east, and west.

There is one new announcement. To view it, type: @announcements

You have been sent to the force renamer! Please type 'help Character Naming Guidelines' to review the guidelines for appropriate character names. Thank you!
You suddenly notice Rattletrap Coyote is no longer standing here.
[Force Renamer]
You are here because your name is considered unacceptable for playing Miriani. Please see HELP CHARACTER NAMING GUIDELINES for what types of names are acceptable. When you are ready to choose a new name, type BEGIN. If you feel you have been sent here in error, assist and explain in an adult manner why you think your name should be allowed. Please do not assist just to argue. Also, you can email hosts@toastsoft.net to state your case.

--------------------------------------------------
Character Naming Guidelines
--------------------------------------------------
In order to help prevent out of character outbursts, names are not allowed to be the same as any currently well-known actor, author, character, or other fictional persona. If you want to be Harvey Robinson, that's fine. But don't be Will Robinson. Character names should also be unique enough so as to be distinguishable from current players. Naming yourself something similar to another player in order to confuse screen readers falls under this policy. Example: Chris Landry is an existing player and you name yourself Kris Landree. Likewise, taking on the last name of an existing player to mislead others into believing that you are related to them, married to them, or ARE them is a violation of this policy. Please use a unique name and don't try to mislead others.

Names must also make sense. If you've never met anybody named Ieat CheeseMmm and can't prove it's a valid name, you will be sent to the force renamer. Similarly, please avoid choosing fantasy sounding names. This includes, but isn't limited to, compound word last names that include animals, emotions, celestial objects, times of day, verbs, body parts, and weapons.

Names must also not be vulgar. That includes homophones such as "Mike Hunt". Speaking of homophones, don't use any homophone names.

We'll provide an example of why this is a bad thing. Let's say you named yourself Will Robinson. I connect and see it and I say, on the general communicator, MAN LOST IN SPACE WAS THE BEST SHOW EVER. I WATCHED IT WITH MY KIDS AND THEY LOVED IT TOO! That's out of character and would have never come up if your name wasn't Will Robinson.

Also, this is no longer the 21st century. I doubt anybody in the year 2353 is going to care about a television show created in the 1960's. Even if a record of it existing did survive, you probably wouldn't discover it or care about it or even know about it. 

Please also consider that we are not an encyclopedia of literature and culture. If you see a name that disrupts the role-play value of the game, by all means, REPORT it. Please don't demand they be force renamed, though, as that's quite rude. A polite request to review their name is best. Thanks.

Who
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  who [aie | commonwealth | hale | organization | newbies | unidle | courier | out of comms | out of local | -ools | <person>]
  @who-record

Description:
  Displays a listing of connected players. If used with no arguments, it will display a player's name, alliance, and out of local/out of comms status. An asterisk (*) indicates that a player is out of communications range, meaning they cannot be contacted at all. A caret (^) indicates that the player is out of local space, meaning they are available for communication but they are physically too far away to interact much with.

  The @who-record command allows you to view the record number of players connected at the same time.

Optional Arguments:
  AIE - Displays connected members of the Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists.
  Commonwealth - Displays connected members of the Commonwealth of Free Spirits.
  Hale - Displays connected members of the Hale Collective.
  Organization - Displays connected members of your private organization, if you happen to be a member of one. This can be abbreviated to 'org'.
  Courier - Typing who courier will tell you what members are awake in your courier company.
  Newbies - Displays connected newbies.
  Unidle - Displays how many of the total connected players have been active within the past 30 minutes.
  Out of comms - Displays only connected players who are out of communications range. This can be abbreviated to 'ooc'. Note: As of 2014 this is Synonymous with OOLS.
  Out of local - Displays only connected players who are out of local space. This can be abbreviated to 'ool'.
  -ools - Displays only connected players who are in local space. (Note the dash before ools.)
  <person> - Typing a player name after who will indicate to you whether or not that player is awake as well as what their gender is

  
Example:
>who Rory Fleemco
Rory Fleemco (A) (Male) is asleep!

--------------------------------------------------
Color Options
--------------------------------------------------
You can access a variety of color options by typing COLOR-OPTIONS. That's color dash options. The following is a detailed account of what the various options mean:

Toggle ANSI Color
 This will enable or disable the ability to see things in color. Note that this requires an ANSI enabled MOO client, such as VMoo or tkMOO-light.

Color Starmap Symbols
 This colors the symbols on the starmap. A red planet has a hostile environment, green is safe, stars are yellow, etc.

Color Room Title
 This will allow you to apply a color to all room titles.

Color Exits
 This option colors the line "You can go north." with whatever color you choose, which allows you to easily differentiate exits from the room's description.

Color General Communications
 This option will allow you to apply a color to the text "[General Communication]"

Color Alliance Communications
 This allows you to color alliance transmissions. "[Commonwealth | Channel 1]" for example.

Color Private Communications
 This option will color the private communication notice "[Private | Albori Sninvel]"

Color Speech
 This option allows you to apply color to anything that is said, making it easy to see when things are said amidst the spam of life.

Color Transmissions
 Unlike the above options, this will color the actual transmission. So if somebody were to transmit "[General Communicaton] Pim Martin transmits, "I like cheese."" you would see [General Communication] in one color and "I like cheese." in another.

Color Damage Report
 When enabled, the damage report will color destroyed components gray, undamaged components green, moderately damaged components yellow, and extremely damaged components red.

Color Flight Control
 This will color the line "A red flight control scanner announces", allowing you to pick flight control transmissions out of the spam.

Color Followers
 This will apply a color to the line that indicates who is following you. This allows you to always be aware when somebody joins your group.

Color Metafrequency Communicators
 This option will color the line "[Frequency 1.0]" in metafrequency communications.

Color Spatial Object Detection Alerts
 This option will color alerts such as "The starship reports the presence of an artifact."

Color Alliances on @who
 This option will display different colors in @who based on alliance. For example, AIE members will show blue, Commonwealth members cyan, and Hale members gray.

Color Newbie Channel
 This option will allow you to apply color to the text "[Newbie]" when a newbie transmission is sent.

Color Camera Output
 This option applies color to the location identifier of internal stun turret cameras. For example, if you have a turret in your airlock and want the text green, it would color the text "[Airlock]". This also applies to battlecruiser external cameras.

Color Organization Channel
 This option will color your private organization channel identifier when a message is transmitted.

Color Short-range Communications
 This option colors the line "[Short-Range Communication]" when you receive such a transmission.

The alliance information center is a small, oddly imposing room with three hallways running out of it. The walls are painted with a light shade of tan that seems to flow off the wall and blend seamlessly with the soft carpet beneath your feet. Above the doorway to each hall hangs a large, colorful emblem for the alliance within. A long, polished desk runs in a u-shape around the room, breaking only to allow entrance through one of the doors leading to the individual alliance information rooms. Behind the desk a number of men and women, all wearing the same style of impeccably tailored business suit, stare out into the group of new recruits, ready to help.

For help, type TALK REPRESENTATIVE.
You see a u-shaped desk, a helpful alliance representative (sitting at a u-shaped desk), and a transparent starship simulator here.
You see Edward Paden (lying on the ground) here, sleeping.
You can go north, east, and west.
