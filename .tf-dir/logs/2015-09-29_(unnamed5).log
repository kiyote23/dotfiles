Soon the clouds part to reveal a vast cluster of tiny rooftops far below you, set at the junction of two winding ribbons of road that extend east, west, and south as far as the eye can see. Such is Bree, center of trade in northwestern Middle-earth. As you near your destination, your descent quickens. Downward you hurtle, faster and faster, closer and closer! With startling rapidity the ground rushes up to meet you! When you come to, you see...

Bree Visiting Room
