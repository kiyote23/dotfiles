        Welcome to Penultimate Destination!

        In this room we will start the journey of creating your character and setting them up for roleplay. Before we do anything, we need to cover two important details.

        First, read the rules by typing news rules

        Second, be aware that you are currently on the Newbie chat channel. We'll cover more about channels later, but for now, if you have a question, you can ask for help by typing +new <question>

        Now that those two items are out of the way, we also suggest you read up on news theme and other news files. You don't have to read them all, but you should read the rules and theme at least, and anything else that you think would be relevant.

        You should also set any flags you may want. For example, if your client supports 256 colors, you should @set me=XTERM256

        In order to proceed, you need to type +accept to state that you have read the rules and are 18 years of age or older.

--- << Rules >> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        By playing on this server, you agree to follow the rules. We've tried to keep these rules simple, and hopefully won't need to expand them too much. Remember that staff are not robots, and thus may have to make judgement calls. In MOST cases this means you have a means of appeal.

        RULE ZERO: No illegal stuff. This means no images that would be considered illegal in most jurisdictions such as bestiality, child pornography, etc. Distributing this sort of thing is a huge threat to us and if we find it, we'll be banning you instantly and probably reporting you to the authorities. Other things that will possibly get you banned are links to pirated software and movies, and any other copyright violations. As an extension of this, you MUST be 18 or older to play here. If it is found that you are younger than 18 years of age, you will be immediately banned.

        RULE ONE: Don't be a jerk. If you're obnoxiously aggressive to others, especially in public, or you harass others, spread inappropriate rumors, and so on, you'll quickly find yourself drawing the ire of staff. This is supposed to be a place to safely explore kinks and fetishes, and if you become aggressive in targeting other players, either personally or in groups, you make this an uncomfortable place. Keep in mind that some of your kinks may also be very squicky to some others, so avoid being overly aggressive in public venues, unless that venue specifically caters to such things(like the Hardcore Requests board)

        RULE TWO: Right to Privacy. Players may list their alts, but are not required to reveal them to anyone. Pressuring someone else to reveal their alts or personal(RL) information is a rules violation. No one, not even staff, has a right to your password, and only Royals and Wizards have access to alt lists. Note that Helpers are not considered staff. Revealing alts of other players to others is also not allowed.

        RULE THREE: Right of Refusal. No one can force you to RP with another person, in any circumstances. If you feel pressured, please report it. This includes feeling pressured by a known staff alt, or someone claiming to be staff.

        RULE FOUR: Consent. No one may affect your character without your OOC consent, and you may not force anything on another player's character without that player's consent. You may waive your consent willingly in some situations, but everyone should keep in mind that this is a cooperative environment, and respect for one another's players is an important part of keeping it a fun and safe environment. Note that staff may at times rule that something particularly lacking in common sense may result in IC penalties, but given the looseness of the theme this is highly unlikely to occur.

        The Penultimate Destination setting is chiefly centered around the lands of Empyrea, floating in the Great Void. No one is exactly certain what the Great Void is, with theories ranging from a gap in spacetime between worlds, to an unformed world that seeks out something to define itself with. In the end, the only thing that matters is this: people and things tend to slip between the 'cracks' of their own worlds and fall into the Great Void, and getting out is difficult. Getting out to where you want to go is much, much more difficult.

        The earliest arrivals had the greatest influence, as the formless Void manifest objects and even land and water from the subconscious desires and needs of those around it, but newer arrivals find their influence, individually, lessened by the presence of so many others. The First Three formed the land of Empyrea, the three siblings arriving to immediately create a sprawling landscape from their desires. The siblings were close, so some common elements helped to form the land into a somewhat cohesive whole.

        No one remembers their names, but according to tales the three could not reach an agreement on how the land and newcomers would be treated. Instead of a unified whole, they formed an uneasy accord, with each retreating to their own section of Empyrea to establish its rules as they desired. In time these rules became altered and grew, most now possessing a labyrinthine set of laws that few can fully comprehend. The spirit of the Three is intact, however.

        The three founding Regions consist of Apos, the central region which maintains a nominally 'normal' existence, which is connected to Diony, the City of Splendor, which is a much more public and hedonistic place. Finally, the vast wilderness areas are largely dominated by Cerel, holding the bulk of natural land, farmland, and rural areas.

        Despite being in a Great Void, Empyrea largely looks like a normal world, though many feel something is slightly 'off' due to the lack of curvature of the land. The stars are often different as well. For more information on the physical layout, see Cosmology.

You enter Basic Setup.
--- << CharGen - Basic Setup >> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ << Create >>

        You should first set up some basic information about your character. We'll cover the very basics.

        If this is not the first character you've made here, you should register your new character with one of your other ones by using +account/request <old character>

        Make sure the target character is online, and have them respond with +account/register Coyote

        Set your character's sex with @sex me=<sex>. It is best if you choose a common value, such as Female, Male, Shemale, Hermaphrodite, Neuter, or the like. The more exotic your choice, the harder it will be for people to search for you.

        If you have alt IDs set up for your alts, you can set them now. See +help +account

        You should write your description here. You should generally shoot for at least a paragraph of description, providing people with a rough idea of your appearance. Remember that this is a text-based environment, so your description makes a good first impression. Be wary of providing TOO much detail, however, as it can easily be overwhelming to some. You can set your description by using the command @desc me=<description>

        To enter a new line, use %r, and for an indent use %t. Your description is limited by the input buffer to roughly 4000 characters, and you should probably stick to that limit. If you desire more detail, you can set views on yourself and put a note at the end of your description pointing to the views. For more information on views, see +help +view

Coyote(#2953PenACcF?k)
Coyote is a young man wearing a dirty jean jacket and a dirty pair of ragged blue jeans. Battered black boots stick out from the worn cuffs of the jeans, and a beat-up black ball cap rests on top of his long, shaggy light brown hair. He's tanned and dirty, as if he's been sleeping under bridges, or somewhere out in the woods. His eyes flit quickly about the room, and he wears a mischievious grin. A bushy light brown tail wags from the seat of his jeans.

You enter Finger Setup.
--- << CharGen - Finger Setup >> ----------------------------------------------------------------------- << Create >>

        You should set your Station here, with +station <station>. Note that your station can be changed freely in character creation, but once in play you must wait after each change. Stations available are Noble, Citizen, and Slave. If you do not set a Station, you will automatically be assigned the Citizen Station. For more information, see news Station

        You should also set some finger information. This isn't required, but we'd recommend you set your Short Desc, Sex Pref, and maybe a bit of General information. The last is a short blurb about your character and the type of play you're looking for.

        For more information on setting your finger, see +help +finger, +help +finger/Setting, and +help +finger/standard

        If you would like more fields, you can add short notes with the custom finger commands listed in help. For moredetailed notes, see +help +info

        If you have not yet set an alias for your character, and you have a long name or name with spaces, you should do so now using @alias me=<alias>. This will make it easier to page you, and you can use the alias to log in. Please avoid using actual names as aliases if possible.

--- << Station >> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        One's Station determines their rights and abilities. It is largely a RP construct, and very little is done to enforce Station in a coded manner, beyond limiting Station changes to once a day. Note that you should probably have a good IC reason for changing your Station, as it does determine your expected income and capabilities from a social standpoint.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- << Station/Citizens >> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Citizens are the default in all areas of Empyrea. They are normal people who can own property, work in an occupation, and in general go about their business. They can own Slaves, but generally do not have the resources to support too many, though on occasion a Citizen will be unreasonably wealthy yet not hold the position of Noble. They are the 'standard' that the other Stations are built upon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAME> That is already your station!
--- << +finger >> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        +finger <name>
        +finger/full <name>
        +finger <name>/<info file>

        This command brings up some character information such as connection status, last on times, and location(if not UNFINDABLE) for a character, along with a listing of public alts. It also includes some, but not all of the given character's profile information by default. If you wish to see all of the character's available information, use +finger/full <name>

        +finger <name>/<info file> is a shortcut to view info files normally seen by +info <name>/<info file>

        Optionally, you may use the +config/finger <option>=<value> command to customize how much information you see with finger. For more information on this, see +help +config/finger

--- << General Profile >> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brash and somewhat cocky, Monika is a fantasy-type adventurer. A rogue, to be more precise. She's not a burgler-type thief; she's more about raiding tombs and dungeons over breaking into people's homes, so, she's not after your stuff. She can be a bit self-interested, but, that's just watching out for herself. She's not selfish or thoughtless, but, she will try to get the best possible deal in a given situation.

        You should set your Station here, with +station <station>. Note that your station can be changed freely in character creation, but once in play you must wait after each change. Stations available are Noble, Citizen, and Slave. If you do not set a Station, you will automatically be assigned the Citizen Station. For more information, see news Station

        You should also set some finger information. This isn't required, but we'd recommend you set your Short Desc, Sex Pref, and maybe a bit of General information. The last is a short blurb about your character and the type of play you're looking for.

        For more information on setting your finger, see +help +finger, +help +finger/Setting, and +help +finger/standard

        If you would like more fields, you can add short notes with the custom finger commands listed in help. For moredetailed notes, see +help +info

        If you have not yet set an alias for your character, and you have a long name or name with spaces, you should do so now using @alias me=<alias>. This will make it easier to page you, and you can use the alias to log in. Please avoid using actual names as aliases if possible.

        These commands allows you to set the +finger information of yourself or others.

        +finger/remove <field> removes a field of that name, be it custom or standard.

        +finger/set <field>=<text> adds a finger field with the given text. Standard profile items have some input restrictions. Field names can include spaces and other characters, but are not evaluated so cannot include ansi.

        +finger/custom <field>=<text> adds a finger field with the given text with a custom name. Field names can include spaces and other characters, but are not evaluated so cannot include ansi.

        +finger/reorder <field>=<order> allows you to set the order in which a custom field appears. It only works on custom fields, and the order # is the new location in which it will appear, pushing everything past that point up one slot.

        +finger/custom will list your custom attribute names and the display name of each, in case you have forgotten.

        For a list of standard finger attributes, see +help +finger/standard

FINGER> Coyote just fingered you.
PAGE
  page[/<switch>] [<player-list>=]<message>
 
  This command sends a message to a player or list of players. If the
  player's name contains spaces, surround it with double-quotes.  If
  you have already paged someone since connecting, just typing:
 
    'page <message>' or 'page =<message>'
 
  will send the message to the last person paged. You cannot page a
  player if they are set HAVEN or if you do not pass their @lock/page.
  In the latter case, the player's PAGE_LOCK`FAILURE,
  PAGE_LOCK`OFAILURE, and PAGE_LOCK`AFAILURE attributes will be
  activated if set.
 
  Examples:
    > page airwolf=hi there!
    You paged Airwolf with 'hi there!'.
    > page see, I don't have to retype the name.
    You paged Airwolf with 'see, I don't have to retype the name.'.
    > page "John Lennon" Ringo=Paul's fine!
 
  Continued in 'help page2'.

It also includes some, but not all of the given character's profile information by default. If you wish to see all of the character's available information, use +finger/full <name>

        +finger <name>/<info file> is a shortcut to view info files normally seen by +info <name>/<info file>

        You should set your Station here, with +station <station>. Note that your station can be changed freely in character creation, but once in play you must wait after each change. Stations available are Noble, Citizen, and Slave. If you do not set a Station, you will automatically be assigned the Citizen Station. For more information, see news Station

        You should also set some finger information. This isn't required, but we'd recommend you set your Short Desc, Sex Pref, and maybe a bit of General information. The last is a short blurb about your character and the type of play you're looking for.

        For more information on setting your finger, see +help +finger, +help +finger/Setting, and +help +finger/standard

        If you would like more fields, you can add short notes with the custom finger commands listed in help. For moredetailed notes, see +help +info

        If you have not yet set an alias for your character, and you have a long name or name with spaces, you should do so now using @alias me=<alias>. This will make it easier to page you, and you can use the alias to log in. Please avoid using actual names as aliases if possible.

Brash and somewhat cocky, Monika is a fantasy-type adventurer. A rogue, to be more precise. She's not a burgler-type thief; she's more about raiding tombs and dungeons over breaking into people's homes, so, she's not after your stuff. She can be a bit self-interested, but, that's just watching out for herself. She's not selfish or thoughtless, but, she will try to get the best possible deal in a given situation.

        You should set your Station here, with +station <station>. Note that your station can be changed freely in character creation, but once in play you must wait after each change. Stations available are Noble, Citizen, and Slave. If you do not set a Station, you will automatically be assigned the Citizen Station. For more information, see news Station

        You should also set some finger information. This isn't required, but we'd recommend you set your Short Desc, Sex Pref, and maybe a bit of General information. The last is a short blurb about your character and the type of play you're looking for.

        For more information on setting your finger, see +help +finger, +help +finger/Setting, and +help +finger/standard

        If you would like more fields, you can add short notes with the custom finger commands listed in help. For moredetailed notes, see +help +info

        If you have not yet set an alias for your character, and you have a long name or name with spaces, you should do so now using @alias me=<alias>. This will make it easier to page you, and you can use the alias to log in. Please avoid using actual names as aliases if possible.

FINGER> Chiyo just fingered you.
--- << CharGen - Finger Setup >> ----------------------------------------------------------------------- << Create >>

        You should set your Station here, with +station <station>. Note that your station can be changed freely in character creation, but once in play you must wait after each change. Stations available are Noble, Citizen, and Slave. If you do not set a Station, you will automatically be assigned the Citizen Station. For more information, see news Station

        You should also set some finger information. This isn't required, but we'd recommend you set your Short Desc, Sex Pref, and maybe a bit of General information. The last is a short blurb about your character and the type of play you're looking for.

        For more information on setting your finger, see +help +finger, +help +finger/Setting, and +help +finger/standard

        If you would like more fields, you can add short notes with the custom finger commands listed in help. For moredetailed notes, see +help +info

        If you have not yet set an alias for your character, and you have a long name or name with spaces, you should do so now using @alias me=<alias>. This will make it easier to page you, and you can use the alias to log in. Please avoid using actual names as aliases if possible.

        You should probably set your +kinks. This is optional, but will tell people a little about what sort of play you're looking for. The general commands are:

        +kinks/list to list the kinks you can choose.
        +kinks/listall to see kinks and subkinks list for each(SPAMMY!)
        +kinks/add <kink1> <kink2> ... to add kinks.
        To add subkinks, use a dash with the subkink number: +kinks/add <kink1> <kink1>-<subkink> <kink2> ...

        For more information, see +help +kinks

        For help specifically with setting your kinks, see +help +kinks/Setting

        For now, don't worry about preference levels and give/receive orientation, and you probably shouldn't worry about subkinks unless you spot one you really want. If you'd like a more thorough guide to how to use the kinks system in conjunction with the search functionality, see +help +kinks/Advice

        As an example, to add the Clothing kink, plus Kimono subkink, and Vaginal sex, type: +kinks/add r1 r1-5 s13

        The kinks system lists the particular player's roleplay and sexual interests. While not complete, the kinks selection should provide a good idea of the various types of RP someone wants.

        To access the list of kinks, use +kinks/list. This provides a list of very general kinks which are a good starting point. Most of these kinks have more specific Subkinks, which can go into great detail and which can be seen by using +kinks/listall. This is a very large list, so you may want to limit it to a category by appending the category code like so: +kinks/listall <letter> or +kinks/list <letter>. For example, use 'R' for Roleplay kinks. To see a list of the kink categories, with their code first, use +kinks/cats

        To view the kinks on a given character, use +kinks <name> or +kinks/all <name> to see all the subkinks as well. When viewing a character's kinks, it will also list how much they like it(Fave for favorite kinks, Yes for kinks they are almost always up for, Maybe for kinks that they might do, and No for kinks that they do not want to deal with), and a letter code for how they like to have it performed: G for Giving, R for Receiving, and B for Both Receive and Give. The listing may also include a Comment. If you are not sure what a kink means, you can enter the kink code into +kinks/info <code> and receive a brief explanation. To search for the existence of a kink by description or by name, you can use the +kinks/index <string> command.

        If desired, you can use +kinks <name>/<kink> or +kinks/all <name>/<kink> to view only a single kink. This also accepts a kink category(such as R or H without a number) to list all a player's kinks in that one category.

        For more information on setting your kinks, see +help +kinks/Setting

        For more information on setting customized kinks, see +help +kinks/Custom

        For more information on searching kinks, see +help +kinks/Search

        +kinks/dump can be used to get a dump of all your kinks and comments, in order to reuse them later.

        +kinks/wipe will not actually wipe your kinks, but will output a command you can copy and paste to wipe all your kinks.

--- << +kinks/Advice >> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        When setting your kinks, be careful not to go overboard and set a pref for every single kink. Not only is this time-consuming, but it's extremely spammy to those looking, and many people will quickly find that it's hard to find what you REALLY want because it's difficult to sift through all the extraneous kinks. Try setting a shorter, simpler kinks list first, and add kink prefs only as you encounter others questioning or making improper assumptions.

        In order to use search to the fullest, be sure to set your orientation for some kinks. This is especially true of preference kinks, where you can set your desired partners as 'Receive' kinks. For example, if you play exclusively with males, you can set Male: Receive and people can thus search for that, making it a far more reliable and accurate indicator than searching sex pref.

        You can also set your own @sex through kinks by using the 'Giving' orientation, but the Receive is usually more important.

        Similarly, when searching try to use the orientation flags to your advantage. Not all kinks make sense to have a Give or Receive preference, but it can help with those that do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        +kinks/catpref <category>=<pref or CLEAR>
        +kinks/del <kinks list>
        +kinks/note <kinks note>
        +kinks/clearnote

        Setting your kinks is normally done with the +kinks/add <list> command. The same command is used to set subkinks as well, by adding a dash and the subkink number to the appropriate kink ID. Kink IDs take the form of the category code(one letter) followed by a number. By default, adding a kink adds it with the Yes preference and the Both orientation, but you may specify it during the add list by adding a colon followed by the first letter of the desired pref and orientation. For example:

        +kinks/add R5 R5-1:M R12:FG

        This would add the R5 Kink as Yes and Both(as of this writing, that would be Long Term, so orientation doesn't really make sense to set), with a Maybe and Both preference for the subkink of 5-1(Long-Term: Grid as of this writing) and also add the R12 Kink as a Favorite with a Giving preference(Pregnancy, as of this writing)

        You may set prefs at any time with the +kinks/pref <pref>=<list> command. For example, +kinks/pref Fave=R12

        Orientation may be set with a similar command, +kinks/orient <give/receive/both>=<list>

        +kinks/catpref <category>=<pref or CLEAR> may be used to add a preference to an entire category of kinks. Prefs are the same as kink prefs: Fave, Yes, Maybe, No. You may also enter CLEAR to remove the category preference.

        Finally, kinks may be deleted with the +kinks/del <list> command.

        +kinks/comment <kink>=<comment> adds a customized comment to the kink, in case you have special conditions or desires regarding it that aren't covered already. Multiple comments can be added at once by separating the lists with a pipe(|) character, like so: +kinks/comment H2=A Comment|H5=A different kink's comment.

        +kinks/addcom <kinks list with comments> works like a combination of +kinks/add and +kinks/comment, also pipe-separated. This allows you to add a kink and define prefs and orientation and a comment, and may accept multiple inputs. For example: +kinks/addcom H2:MR=A Comment|H5:FG=A different kink's comment.

        +kinks/note <text> will add a note to the end of your kinks listing. Clear it using +kinks/clearnote

        You should probably set your +kinks. This is optional, but will tell people a little about what sort of play you're looking for. The general commands are:

        +kinks/list to list the kinks you can choose.
        +kinks/listall to see kinks and subkinks list for each(SPAMMY!)
        +kinks/add <kink1> <kink2> ... to add kinks.
        To add subkinks, use a dash with the subkink number: +kinks/add <kink1> <kink1>-<subkink> <kink2> ...

        For more information, see +help +kinks

        For help specifically with setting your kinks, see +help +kinks/Setting

        For now, don't worry about preference levels and give/receive orientation, and you probably shouldn't worry about subkinks unless you spot one you really want. If you'd like a more thorough guide to how to use the kinks system in conjunction with the search functionality, see +help +kinks/Advice

        As an example, to add the Clothing kink, plus Kimono subkink, and Vaginal sex, type: +kinks/add r1 r1-5 s13

        The Watch system notifies you when a watched character logs on, presuming they haven't set themselves to not notify. It has a broad selection of commands.

        +watch and +watch/online are identical, and provide a list of online players on your watchlist. +watch/where does the same, but instead of providing the comment for that character, provides their location if possible. +watch/who lists every character you are watching for, online or offline, and further breaks down if you are watching via your account or only on this character's personal watch list.

        To add someone to your watchlist, use +watch/add <name>. This will add them to your account watchlist and personal watchlist, and all registered alts will also receive notifications of their connection or disconnection from the mush. If you only want the current character to watch for a character, and not inform your alts, use +watch/cadd <name>. You can add a character to your account watchlist without adding them to your personal watchlist with +watch/aadd <name>. All of these commands include the option to provide a brief comment, using the format +watch/add <name>=<comment>, +watch/aadd <name>=<comment> or +watch/cadd <name>=<comment>. To stop watching for a character, use +watch/rem <name> to remove it from account and/or personal watchlists. To remove it from an account watchlist only, use +watch/arem <name>, and use +watch/crem <name> to remove a character from your personal watchlist.

        Comments can be added to pre-existing watched characters with the +watch/comment command. By default, this will add a comment to the account entry, if you have one for that character. If not, it adds it to the personal watchlist. If you wish to add to the personal watchlist instead of the account watchlist, use +watch/ccomment instead.

        If you wish to receive notifications from your account-wide watchlist, you can use +watch/account on to notify this character when someone on your account-wide list logs on. This is off by default. Use +watch/account off to stop receiving account-wide notifiers. If you don't want to receive ANY watch notifications, use +watch off. Use +watch on to resume watch notification.

        Finally, if you do not want other players to be aware of your connection and disconnection, use +watch/hide on. You may also hide from a specific player, using +watch/hide on=<name>.

        Watchlists are cleaned on login automatically, and in addition the storage method used should ensure that you never receive an invalid object's notification.

If they are not marked with either, you are using the defaults. The +config/account command will show only which configuration items are set via your account.

        Every other +config command requires a Type, which can have an optional /account switch. Using the /account switch sets the configuration value across all your registered alts. Setting a local command will always override any account-wide command.

        Each Type has one or more Options that can be set, with various allowed Values. Usually, you enter a blank value to clear the value. If a config Type has a different behavior the specific help file will list it.

        For details of Options and Values, see the subentries below, which list available types.

        You're pretty much set! Before you go out into the wide world, a couple more tidbits of information to help you along. Keep in mind some of these commands won't be available until you leave the room:

        @chan/list will show you the various channels you can join to chatter.
        @chan/join <channel> will join a channel.
        @chan/off <channel> leaves a channel. You may want to leave Newbie
        @chan/gag <channel> and @chan/ungag <channel>
        +help +watch will show you how to use the watch system.

        You can configure various views and tweak behaviors with +help +config

        Finally, before wandering the mush, you may want to read +help Navigating

DESC> Yang Xiao Long just looked at you.
Yang Xiao Long

        You have the right to remain silent~! Or in this case, resist arrest...

        While usually typified by other clothing that befitted a Huntress in training, the young lady known as Yang Xiao Long was dolled up in a fashion that would lend one to think she was cosplaying as an officer of the law: if that law happened to be brazen sexual proclivities. 'Officer' Yang is wearing an ensemble that calls to mind the sexy police officer costumes but with her own flair and particular stylings. An officer's hat of navy blue persuasion starts things off, a gold badge emblem resembling her personal sigil of a flame, the hat slightly off-center given her wild mane of hair. Her hair is long and vaguely straight, ending somewhere just past her waist and gorgeously lustrous: she definitely keeps up with it almost as much if not more than the rest of her curvy, athletically well-built body. Golden locks hang loosely down the front and side of her face, framing her face quite well, sometimes veiling across the uppermost field of her vision and down between her lilac-tinted eyes.

        Her uniform on the other hand is a uniform in name only, though one could credit her for particular touches such as the lapel and the gold aiguillette worn on her right shoulder that loops under her arm on the uniform jacket. The braided cord looks like it belongs there, certainly on the navy blue uniform jacket, which is roomy in the sleeves and shoulders but is /exceptionally/ tightly fitted around the equally snug white shirt covering that one could only see a little bit of fabric for. At best, the unbuttoned collar is visible, the remainder disappearing down the sides of the uniform shirt. The reason for this is rapidly clear: the snugness of the fit all but proudly displays her breasts, modesty remaining only by means of a black cotton bra that is filled so fully, her breasts pushed together in a nearly perfect display of flesh and sexuality.

        Adding to this spillage of her breasts is the fact that the uniform jacket is cinched up the between by a single gold button, practically tucked just under the midpoint of the bra itself, a bare hint of navy blue hidden by the girl's breasts pushed up and out so prominently. She's definitely had a growth spurt if she's as young as she states to be: the swell and contour of her breasts are quite sizable and supple--if she were a slim girl, she'd definitely have back problems in the future. To call her busty would be the most polite way of putting it for the blonde bombshell, such curves lending themselves well to the rest of her form. A little walkie-talkie is even clipped onto her right shoulder as an accessory, with the sleeves of the uniform shirt itself folded up and ending just above her elbows with a pair of short black gloves accompanying the look of her upper body. 

        Make no mistake, this young lady takes care of her body. A six-pack would be too much focus on one area--her entire midsection and every inch of her upper and lower body show signs of achieving that unique balance between strength and flexibility, her washboard abs while certainly powerful, bely the supple smoothness of her skin. Her hips flare slightly, lending a curvy element to her figure, strongly built yet shapely, supple thighs forming the core of some killer legs. Indeed, she's quite comfortable using her body's natural assets: she's wearing a black side-tie thong which hangs on her hips even with her innie of a belly button, long cords guaranteeing easy access to untie them as they brush against low-slung navy shorts. They're snug shorts, but they're practically hugging her hips--any lower and one might begin to see where the strings of the thong end and actual thong begins. A black belt helps keep those shorts falling any lower on those delectable, shapely curves her attire teases at. Knee-high black boots complete the ensemble, only with the slighest of heels to draw further attention to the young lady's curvaceous backside and thighs.

Rachnera has shown a rather misanthropic attitude from her mistreatment given her by her former Host Family. Showing the classic sadism of her species, she exhibits a personality that is playful, coy, and often teasing. She has a dislike of those who are untruthful, to the point of making her rather dangerous to those who lie to and deceive her. She is confident, and flagrantly open with her womanly charms, and enjoys both the fear she generates in those who dislike or are afraid of spiders. An exhibitionist in personality, the clothing she wears is much more revealing then it used to be with her sexual nature out in the open. She has a distrust of authority and yet shows a subtle loyalty for those who have earned her trust, though that doesn't protect them from the games she plays. She would gladly trip a man into bed she found attractive, and is a great risk for the current laws against Extraspecies sex. This is why her placement with Darling is so amusing.

Lustra has disconnected.
Blake Belladonna

        A head of black tresses falls down the young woman's head, often left to simply fall down her shoulders and back, save for the larger then average black bow she wears on the top of her head. Short bangs run across her forehead, letting much of the light-olive skin tone show on her. Eyes of amber glance around on occasion to take in her surroundings, allowing someone to see they are tilted slightly upward in a catlike fashion, and have a bit of purple eyeshadow brushed around them. With a petite nose, and thin, unpainted lips, it allows her a simple, natural look.
        A scarf-like collar is wrapped around her neck, thick and covering it, while also brushing down her back some. Her upper body is held in a white, sleeveless undershirt, while a black vest is around and cups under her bust, letting the shirt accent it, while the vest buttons underneath. With the pair of items, a hint of her belly button and some of her midriff can be seen. From where it's buttoned, the vest does extend down, in two small point flaps in front, with long coattails down the back that cover her bottom some. Her left arm, from wrist to upper arm, has a black, detached sleeve over it, a small silver band around her upper arm of the sleeve, while showing some black, ribbon straps wrapped around her wrist some. Her right arm has similar ribbon around her wrist, showing her skin between spots, while also including a part that makes an angle to her middle finger and wraps around the base of it.
        The shorts hug her hips snuggly, two black strips running down the front and back of them. She wears black tights underneath, that run down her thighs, although slowly shade into purple as they reach her ankles. Her feet wear short heeled boots, both with their collars turned down. On occasion, she can be seen carrying a thick case on her back, with a sword handle coming from the top.

        Welcome to the OOC Nexus! You may notice that you can't actually speak in this Nexus. This is intentional! The Nexus is meant as a waypoint between various functions of the mush, and staying in to chat tends to make things very spammy, very fast.

        If you'd like to have discussions, consider the channel system.

--- << Meeting of Ways - Cross Plaza >> ------------------------------------------------------------------ << Apos >>

        Perpetually busy, Cross Plaza is only technically under the aegis of Apos. As the meeting ground between all three regions, it is extremely high-traffic, but fortunately quite large as well. Being a very commonly-seen place, effort has been put into making it as attractive as possible.

        Much of the plaza is covered in a gleaming white cobblestone, smoothed over by constant foot traffic. At regular intervals, small areas of earthen soil have remained to sprout lush green grass, or sometimes a few trees, to spruce up the place with greenery or even the occasional picnic. Benches at regular intervals allow for people-watching, and the footpaths are often flanked on one side or the other by small stands or carts selling simple refreshments or entertainment at all hours of the day.

        In the center of the plaza is the major landmark of this area, a large fountain ringed with a stone bench. The fountain stands twice the height of a human, with the top bearing three vague bronze statues, one female and two male, depicting the Three original arrivals. A fine patina of green covers every statue, and they seem curiously unmolested by pigeons or the like.

--- << Cerel Road - Boundary Pillars >> ----------------------------------------------------------------- << Cerel >>

        While the other realms are immediately organized, Cerel takes a much more laid back approach. The main road is a mix of dirt and inlaid stone, depending on the surrounding terrain, but at least the entrance is laid out in a cobblestone greeting to those who start on their way. No fancy gates or opulent greetings, for here... but it does make an impression nonetheless.

        The road's entrance is flanked by two massive pillars, each over twenty meters high. They aren't particularly spotless and immaculate pillars, more like stacked rough discs of stone that are even a little off-center and leaning. They do serve their purpose in marking the border and providing landmarks, and they also give plenty of support to the occasional cart or stand that sets up here to sell last-minute supplies or maps of questionable accuracy.

Huh? Don't know that command.
@CHANNEL
 
  The @channel command is used to add, join, list and modify channels in the
  chat system. It takes many different switches.
 
  Help for @channel is split into a number of topics. Please see 'help 
  @channel <topic>' for more, where <topic> is one of the words below. For
  help on a specific switch to @channel, use 'help @channel/<switch>'.
 
  Joining    - How to find, join, and leave channels
  Other      - Setting channel titles, recalling previous chat messages
  Admin      - Adding, deleting and modifying channels

  @channel/list[/on|/off][/quiet] [<prefix>]
  @channel/what [<prefix>]
  @channel/who <channel>
  @channel/on <channel>[=<player>]
  @channel/off <channel>[=<player>]
 
  @channel/list shows a list of all the channels you can see, along with some
  basic information such as whether you are on the channel, how it's locked,
  etc. 'help @channel list' explains the output in detail. If a <prefix> is
  given, only channels whose names begin with <prefix> are shown. If the /on
  switch is given, only channels you've joined are shown. If /off is given,
  channels you are on will not be shown. The /quiet switch shows just a list
  of channel names, without any extra information.
 
  @channel/what shows the name, description, owner, priv flags, mogrifier and 
  buffer size for all channels, or all channels whose names begin with
  <prefix> if one is given.
 
  @channel/who lists all the players on the given channel.
 
  @channel/on and @channel/off add or remove you from the given <channel>.
  You only hear messages for channels you're on, and most channels require you
  to join them before you can speak on them. /join and /leave are aliases for
  /on and /off.

--- << Meeting of Ways - Cross Plaza >> ------------------------------------------------------------------ << Apos >>

        Perpetually busy, Cross Plaza is only technically under the aegis of Apos. As the meeting ground between all three regions, it is extremely high-traffic, but fortunately quite large as well. Being a very commonly-seen place, effort has been put into making it as attractive as possible.

        Much of the plaza is covered in a gleaming white cobblestone, smoothed over by constant foot traffic. At regular intervals, small areas of earthen soil have remained to sprout lush green grass, or sometimes a few trees, to spruce up the place with greenery or even the occasional picnic. Benches at regular intervals allow for people-watching, and the footpaths are often flanked on one side or the other by small stands or carts selling simple refreshments or entertainment at all hours of the day.

        In the center of the plaza is the major landmark of this area, a large fountain ringed with a stone bench. The fountain stands twice the height of a human, with the top bearing three vague bronze statues, one female and two male, depicting the Three original arrivals. A fine patina of green covers every statue, and they seem curiously unmolested by pigeons or the like.

        A soaring space of marble, the main room of the Blueflame Bank has been decorated in a plush, comfortable display of opulence. Tasteful shades of white and blue comprise the majority of the decorating, with bits of other color here and there for accent, and every desk and counter in the sprawling space is elegantly worked to include some sort of dragon motif, from flames to gold to soaring wyrms.

        Looming over the room from behind and above the tellers is a grand, white marble statue of a dragon, standing proud with wings outstretched upon a pedestal into which is carved a simple phrase: "Erekess Enel, Noach." The entire space is lit during the day by the ample light allowed in through the skylights of the great dome, and during the night or times of stormy weather by enchanted crystal lighting here and there.

        It is a fitting look for the main room of Blueflame Bank, all in all; for this is the room where the bulk of the business happens. Arranged in a broad loop, the center of the room is dominated by a ring of help desks, staffed by and large with elven men and woman of exquisite taste and fashion sense alike. They are the 'ambassadors' of the bank, after all, and the first place anyone will come for information; if they can't help, they know who can.

        To the east, one will find the bank's tellers and currency exchange. To the north, there is both the doorway into the Artifact Wing and the loan and investment officers. To the south, a stone archway that leads down to the vaults, surrounded by the bank's host of accountants. Here and there, small waiting areas have been set up, and nestled between the tellers and the loan officers is a vending machine.

                          There are +views set here.

Sasha
Your eyes fall upon an astoundingly beautiful, sexy Vixen-anthro, covered head-to-toe in fine orangish-red fur. She stands nude before you-save for a tight black leather choker, displaying every inch of her nigh perfect body, apparently taking more towards the 'natural' aspects of her animal lineage and not seeming quite aware that it might be more acceptable for her to do otherwise. Her legs are long, luscious, her thighs and fleshy round ass toned to perfection. Her body is slim, and curvy, her arms and shoulders pleasantly slender. Confusing the issue of how she can always stand up straight, are two large, firm, perfectly shaped breasts, that bounce and sway with every step she takes. Looking up above her graceful neck is her pretty/cute face, framed by two canine ears slanted downwards, and aiming horizontally in opposite directions. Adding to her beauty are her large, dazzling emerald green eyes. Quite a nice sight in any sense.

Sasha is mostly an anthro sandbox character meant to facilitate sexy stories surrounding a Fox woman. The specifics of who she is can vary to suit the story, and I can play multiple/different female characters, but Sasha is nearly always at the center of my interest. I prefer anthro foxes and wolves as partners, but the occasional human Master wouldn't go amiss! Obviously you don't have to chargen any of this stuff, I'm more than happy to let good partners simply @emit characters for the sake of the story/scene. :) Stories can range from sweet, to dark, but I like to keep things kinky/raunchy regardless.

I have, like, a million scenario suggestions in my +info to build off of.

Taitaniku-chan is a ship girl, but, unlike most of the others one might find, she's not a battleship. She's not really combat ready at all, actually; she's a cruise liner for civilians with enough money to get away from it all. She does her best, but somehow...things just happen, and disaster seems to sttrike for her a lot more regularly than others. She's not a klutz, she's not inattentive; it's really just that if something can go wrong for her, it probably will. As a result, she's often brused and bandaged, but, she isn't in need of rescue. The only one abusing the poor dear is life itself. People, for the most part, are quite kind ot her, here.

Caria

        The figure of Caria is certainlly imposing enough, if not from her height, there's the way the armored figure moves and holds herself that certainly makes it seem she won't be going down without a struggle. Her head is covered by a helmet designed to invoke the imagery of a hawk, painted gold down the center with the visor resembling the beak of a brd of prey and jutting outslightly above the occular sensors and rebreath that covers her face. A red hood pulled up and over, attatched to what seems like a patchwork red cloak that trails behind her just above the ground, stitched up the center, with black ichor of some manner spattered across it in places. A hestplate made of composite carbon and metal covers her chest, molded to follow the feminine frame of her figure, while a tight undersuit made of more compsite materials and spandex snugly hugs her trim belly. A tactical belt is strapped around her waist, a tactical knife strapped at her right hip, while the belt is attatched to a harness on her left thigh, a black and gold handcannon strapped there, loooking to be quite the large revolver. Her shoulders are covered by a pair of plates, while long red sleeves tightly hug her arms before reaching the gloves, a mix of tight material, with armored plautes on the back of the hand, and knuckles. Another knife not quite as large as the one at her hip strapped to her left forearm. 

Caria's hips flare out shjowing off her trim figure with skin tight beige pants hugging her toned yet slender legs, while a pair of composite armor plates cover her shins, and army boots beneath them.

Happy, perky, and full of pep and enthusiam, Vacha is a joyful, eager doggie, yes she is! Whosagoodgirl, yes she is! Okay, she is, technically a creature summoned up from the abyssal realms, but, that little detail aside, you'd almost never know it to interact with her. She's friendly, affectionate and.... well... not actually stupid, but, she tends to act without thinking, and generally lets her heart rule her decision making, with the brain being a conscientious objector when she decides to pounce and slather an unsuspecting victim with eager puppy-kisses.
