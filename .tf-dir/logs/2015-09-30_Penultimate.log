        Welcome to the OOC Nexus! You may notice that you can't actually speak in this Nexus. This is intentional! The Nexus is meant as a waypoint between various functions of the mush, and staying in to chat tends to make things very spammy, very fast.

        If you'd like to have discussions, consider the channel system.

Mags is an androgynous genetically engineered human designed for operation in zero-g and tight spaces. Wings to "fly" and cat-like bendiness to reach that tricky flux-confabulator relay bypass. He's got a bit of nano-cyberware as well for various shipboard utility.

Brash and somewhat cocky, Monika is a fantasy-type adventurer. A rogue, to be more precise. She's not a burgler-type thief; she's more about raiding tombs and dungeons over breaking into people's homes, so, she's not after your stuff. She can be a bit self-interested, but, that's just watching out for herself. She's not selfish or thoughtless, but, she will try to get the best possible deal in a given situation.

Sly Monika

         She's not what most people would call physically imposing. Oh, sure, she towers over, like, pixies and little faeries and stuff, but, by more average standards, there's not all that much of Monika, physically. However, what she lacks in mass, she seems to make up for in moxie, and many have learned it's not a good idea to underestimate her. 
         She stands at a rather underwhelming 4ft 3in, slight of build, and unlikely to top 80lbs, even sopping wet. A bit childlike at first glance, perhaps, but, there are certain aspects about her and how she carries herself that don't read as so immature. Her violet eyes are sharp and clever, revealing an apt mind behind that cute, smirking face, and, when coupled with her impressive and sensitive mouse ears, very little goes on around her that she's unaware of, those big, round, gray ears cresting out of her silky-soft, slate colored hair, kept bobbed short in a pixie cut, keeping it managable and out of the way, but, perhaps contributing to her youthful appearance. 
         She dresses simply, for ease of movement (and perhaps a degree of exhibitionism), refraining from any jewelery that could catch and snag on things, choosing to accessorize with a simple silk kerchif scarf tied in a large bow behind her neck, the soft material draping over her shoulders like a miniature cloak. The rest of her upper torso is almost all bared and tanned flesh, the slender rodent lady covering what needs covering with a tight, stretchy halter top in a 'cheese' motief, bright yellow and dotted here and there with peeakaboo holes in tantalizing, but not quite scandalous places. 
         That top leaves a glorious expance of well-toned tummy exposed, spreading down into widening hips, clad in form-fitting black shorts that cut off mid-thigh. This leaves the rest of her legs gloriously bare, though, she does get a bit more 'mousy' aroundabout the knees, with soft fur below her shins leading down to bare, pink toed feet, shod in simple thong sandals. It may bear mentioning her arms are simularly furred below the elbows, I just spaced and forgot to mention that earlier when I was going on about her upper body.

Linnea

        Standing at five foot nine, this sharkgirl is rounded and sleek in her features, being that her body is all muscle and cartilage. She's also currently not wearing a stitch of clothing other than her collar. 

        Her skin, absent the denticles normally associated with non-morpic sharks, is perfectly smooth, without wrinkle or crease to be found excepting for the ridges of her gill-slits at her sides, halfway down her torso. Pigmented like a shark, she's mostly grey except for a swath of pale ivory that starts just below her soft amber eyes and covering much of her humanoid face. That color plunges in a line down around her firm c-cup breasts-- each capped in a darker grey nipple, and sweeps to just past her inner thighs where the tight little whisper of her feminine sex rests, the barely visible fold that conceals her internal sheath slightly above. Bright red stripes wrap like downward chevrons around her arms, legs, and tail, adding a bit of color to her otherwise two-toned appearance. 

        The soft curtain of the girl's hair is a shining silvery-white, and shorn on the sides to the scalp, otherwise falling in a shoulder-length angled bob longer in the front than the back. At the top of her head and at her temples-- her locks are parted by the tall points of her large, finlike ears and small ivory horns. Her arms and legs, toned and curved from a lifetime of swimming have small shark fins protruding from the backs of her forearms and calves. Each digit on her hands and her elongated, digitigrade feet are webbed slightly and end in a small, sharp clawtip. A heavily muscled tail, long and thick extends from just above the bubbly curve of her backside, extending easily five feet behind her, tapering towards the a backswept, crescent-shaped and red striped fin. This 'primary' tail is flanked by a thinner tail on each side, just as long but whiplike, ending in a demonic spade.

        She wears no real makeup-- the black shading over her eyelids and darkening her plush lips apparently natural or inked-on permanently. Piercings however, abound on her features-- silver rings adorn her ears in mismatched sets, while single slender rings pierce her right eyebrow and the left side of her nose beneath the barbell in its shallow bridge. Three more rings pierce her lips, one on either side on her lower and the third on her upper lip centered between. Slightly thicker rings are set through her nipples, leaving them perpetually stiff. More unusually, a line of silver surface piercings in the form of conical studs trace a line every inch or so from the valley between her breasts down to the piercing in her navel, which sits perfectly in the dimple of her belly, an ruby captured within the setting.

Lin had some sort of life before the Void drew her here-- but she doesn't seem to remember it. She doesn't seem particularly troubled by her loss of memory either. Mostly, she enjoys swimming about, and exploting the fact that being an anthromorph makes her functionally amphibious. Despite her savage nature, she freely admits that humanoids taste terrible, though she would say so much more 'colorfully', and is quite friendly unless threatened-- often acting very much like she once was someone's pet.

Linnea is happiest as a pet or slave, and while she won't submit to just anyone, this is ideally the situation I am looking for the sharkgirl-- to belong to someone who will appreciate her. In return, they will get an unerringly loyal, if strange and a bit promiscuous (and foul-mouthed) pet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<General> Caw Caw, Motherfucker Utsuho Reiuji returns to gen chat. But is there even anything worth chatting about? Shi has no ideas.
Beriel
        Fuscia-colored hair styled into fangs on either side of a mature womanly face with high cheekbones and a pointed chin. In the bag, bound into a billowy ponytail by a brass clasp. Separated on the sides by pointed elf-like ears and, just beyond them, jagged looking horns resembling several jointed layers of black bone. Deep blue eyes behind brass glasses in an underwire frame. This is the mortal form of Beriel, previously an ordinary woman who has since become... this.
        Her clothing doesn't leave much to the imagination in regards to her body, though. Her sleeves are puffy juliet-style at the shoulder, slimming down to hug her arms at the bicep and all the way to her wrist, where purple gives way to folded-back white cuffs with matching purple pipe trim. There's a similar folded-over white collar lined with ruffles and more piping around her neck and shoulders, with a large red gem resembling an eye set above her collarbone. The rest of her dress hugs her body, tailored to contour to her figure with violet silk. This hugs over the swells of her generous breasts, with a dip in the center that neatly separates them and guides them into that heavy teardrop shape while still supporting them. Below, the dress hugs her midriff to well past her hips, where it finally separates away and hangs as a loincloth that reaches her knees. The sides are cut, with narrow purple straps right over her hips, and a similar chongsam-like cloth tapestry hangs off her shapely rump. Her long, sculpted legs are covered by white stockings with violet highlights at the tops, and her feet feed into small purple high heeled pumps that add a sultry sway to her hips with every step.
        Everything about her clothes emphasizes or draws attention to the curves of her body, and with those horns and the sinewy, spade-tipped tail protruding from the base of her spine, all of this suggests she's some form of succubus. However, her demeanor is far more friendly and outgoing than one might expect from such a creature, with no real hints of the usual seductive predator she resembles.
        Depending on the situation, Beriel may be accompanied by fairy-like familiars, tiny girls with bat-like wings and devil tails. They resemble her, with slightly different shades of hair, and act as servants. Due to their size, they're often unclothed.

Ignis
        Long, mint green hair falls freely down to this woman's lower back, unbound by any sort of styling or ornament. Her hair is a shaggy mess, but it looks rather soft and silky to the touch despite the wild manner in which it is kept, and such fits its owner quite well. Her bangs are brushed aside and give a good view of her pretty eyes, , the same shade of minty green as her hair. nice and big and pretty. She has a cute button of a nose set above a pair of full, kissable lips with a faint touch of gloss to them. Though she is a rather lovely girl, shes also an intimidating sight, standing nearly seven feet tall and looking rather ferocious if she desires it.

        There isn't a shred of clothing on this girl, though it may look otherwise at a glance. Her body is covered in parts by plates of a sort that appear to be part of her skin, mint green as seems to be the theme save for the occasional yellow-ish jut interspersed throughout. On both her forearms and shins there is a coating of fur, rather long yet very fine and smooth to touch, her wrists and ankles covered by the same yellow plates that decorate her arms and legs though her hands are left clear and are human in appearance, her feet less so and bearing rather sharp looking black claws. Her back is covered by a layer of the same fur that decorates her limbs, just as long and smooth though beneath it exists the same plating that covers her limbs, extending all the way to her lower back where a long, broad tail juts out. Otherwise, she's fully nude, her skin cream in color and so soft and smooth, her breasts large and firm, capped with cute little pink nipples. Her stomach is flat and toned, and down lower is a small patch of mint green fuzz just above her womanhood. As unusual as it may be, her nudity doesn't seem to faze her one tiny bit.

Jaedda
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Jaedda is a slender and toned woman, standing at a height of five
feet and eight inches. By appearances, she couldn't weigh more than one
hundred and forty pounds. Though her true age is difficult to assess, her
outward appearance is that of youth, and would lead others to guess that she
is in her late teens or early twenties.
        The majority of her form is covered in metallic, sapphire scales.
Along her front, from her lower jaw just above her throat, over her chest,
belly, a small portion of her inner thighs, and the underside of her tail,
Jaedda's scales become a lighter shade, nearly glaucous. These scales are
smaller and more flexible than the armor-like sapphire, lending a supple,
more fleshy feel to her "underbelly".
        Her hair appears black, though is in truth a very dark shade of blue.
It is shoulder-length, feathered in an almost "messy" style, and grows from
about halfway back the top of her head. Her skull is draconic in shape, with
an elongated, squared muzzle. Her 'ears' are non-existant; in their place are
two pointed fins that run along the side of her face, the upper edge of which
runs to the ridges above her eyes that have replaced her eyebrows.
        Her eyes are almond-shaped, a deep jade green in color, and angled on
her skull to allow her to look forward as well as allowing a wider feild of
vision to the sides. Her nostrils, on the end of her snout, are slightly
flared. Within her muzzle are dozens of sharp teeth, pronounced fangs, and a
long, slender, forked tongue.
        Jaedda's strong neck leads down to proudly-held shoulders and
strapping arms. Around her neck is a collar, two inches wide and made of
metal a quarter inch thick. Engraved in the front is "Kristen Braun, Prisoner
#17785-01". There are no latches or locks on the collar.
        The dragon-woman's hands are humanoid in shape, though each finger
ends in a short, sharp claw. On the bottom of her wrists is something akin to
a two foot long, flexible bone. Attached to these extensions and the length
of her arm are a pair of wings, though they are purely aesthetic as Jaedda is
far too heavy and the wings far too small to give her proper flight. They are
capable of folding back against her forearm.
        Jaedda isn't bulky by any means, having the physique of a track
runner rather than a weight-lifter. The curve of her bust is generous, but
not overly large; her breasts would best be described as a healthy c-cup. Her
stomach is flat - her abs are hidden beneath a layer of scales. Jaedda's
waist is slender, flaring out to wide hips, giving her an alluring hourglass
figure.
        A long, reptilian tail protrudes from just above her cute, firm
backside, roughly six feet in length. Her legs are powerful yet shapely;
muscles glossed over by scales maintains her toned appearance. Clearly, it
would be difficult to out-run the dragoness, unless one were something more
like a gazelle, or cheetah, or automobile. Those long legs lead down to
draconic feet, three clawed toes in front, and a heel-claw in the rear.
        Jaedda is not wearing anything at all. Her supple, perky breasts are
exposed, both capped with a small azure nipple, further revealing her
mammalian heritige. Between her thighs, one can make out the cornflower-blue
petals of her sex, occasionally glistening with moisture. Though its often
quite hidden by her tail, one can occasionally catch a glimps of the tight
pucker between the two pert half-globes of her ass.
        Being a prisoner, Jaedda has had the misfortune of having a pair of
metal cuffs secured to her wrists and ankles. Both sets are two inch wide,
seamless metal with no gap between them and her scales, as though they had
been molded to her for a perfect fit. It also quite effectively prevents her
from being able to get enough of a grip on them to tear them off - and
judging from the marks on them, Jaedda has certainly tried.
        Attached to the front of her collar, and hanging down between her
breasts to her lower abdomen is a length of chain with a leather loop handle
at its end. Around her maw is a two-inch wide band of metal, seamless like
the others, fit snugly to keep her mouth securely shut.

Utsuho Reiuji(#1728PVenACck)
A girl with Black hair going down to her butt and black wings growing from her back. She wears a big green bow in her hair, a cape hung over her wings, A white blouse and a green skirt. On the inside of the cape, you can see a swath of stars like you're looking at a galaxy and as she and the cape moves, the stars seem to stay in place as if the cape were just a window to them. On her chest is a large red jewel resembling a vertically slit eye and it dominates most of the front of her torso. On her right arm is a long hexagonal device reminiscient of a nuclear control rod with strange symbols carved into it. The shaft is long enough that, when held to her side, reaches to her knees. Other than white kneesocks and buckled shoes, around her left anke orbits electrons symbolizing her atomic nature and on her right foot is covered in a congealed mass of something or other. Cooled radioactive material maybe?
<General> King Saber hopes you don't mind other people referring to you as "she" or "they", at least.

Betty
She's a nerdy girl, tall, a bit plain, with black horn-rimmed glasses that dwarf her hazel eyes. Her blonde hair is a little longer than shoulder-length, styled with a curtain of thick bangs in the front and a high ponytail in the back. Her nose is snub, set into a round face dusted with the barest hint of freckles along the tops of her cheeks. Her thin lips are usually set in a self-conscious smirk, her first line of defense against the world.

Her clothes are expensive and fashionable--provided one's fashion sense is rooted firmly in 1950's America. Her dress is a deep navy blue, decorated with quarter-sized white polka dots. Sleeveless, the halterneck gives it a little hint of flirtiness, but the swing skirt ends well past her knees, swishy, but demure. She wears a matching white ribbon in her hair, a big bow to hold her ponytail in place, the style making her seem younger than her 18 years, more appropriate to someone still in high school. She doesn't wear hose; instead, her bare legs disappear into lace-topped white bobby socks worn with black and white saddle Oxfords.

She's a slender girl, slight of hip and bust, long thin limbs with graceful fingers. She doesn't wear any makeup beyond a hint of clear lip gloss, nor any jewelry save a diamond engagement ring. She carries herself shyly, bared shoulders slightly stooped, as if she's trying to take up less space.

Betty's only 18, but to people with a post-millenial mindset, she might seem a bit older, as she grew up in an alternate version of Earth's 1940s and 50s. Accordingly, her morals and general sense of propriety are likewise old fashioned.

------------------------------- << Betty's Background Info >> --------------------------------

        Betty hails from Andrew Ryan's city under the sea, Rapture, having grown up there, her parents among the first inhabitants, arriving with the first wave of emmigrants in November of 1946. She had about as normal a childhood as one could have in such an environment, growing up into a bookish young lady, more interested in Plasmids and Bathyspheres than in finding a suitable husband, much to her parents' dismay. Plans of attending one of the universities of the mainland were put on hold as unrest grew in the objectivist utopia, and she accepted--unhappily--the marriage proposal of an older man her parents approved of for lack of anything better to do. 
        Before she had to go through with the sham of a marriage, she chanced upon a tear in reality during a riot (a precursor to the more famous New Year's Eve Riots of 1958) and slipped through into Empyrea. Since arriving, she's done her best to secure a modest life for herself, keeping her head down.

---------------------------------- << Betty's Note Info >> -----------------------------------
Betty is not a video game character. She's a real flesh and blood human from an alternate dimension where the events of Bioshock actually transpire and where physics and biology work according to the established game mechanics... to a point. She can't miraculously hide eight different weapons in her skirt. Indeed, she doesn't even know how to shoot a gun.

------------------------------- << Betty's Personality Info >> -------------------------------

        Betty is from Rapture, having lived there from the tender age of 5 all the way until age 18, when she entered a rift into this realm. She attended Ryan the Lion Prepatory Academy, then very exclusive private schools in Olympus Heights, always top of her class. Accordingly, she knows how to talk the objectivist talk, and walk the party line walk. She is, however, a normal human teenager, prone to rolling her eyes at the weird things her parents--diehard Rapture faithful--might espouse. She has the naive belief that the best, strongest, and smartest always prosper and rise to the top, while the weakest, most foolish, and laziest never will. But she's not an asshole about it. If you're her friend, and you fail, it's probably not /your/ fault. There must have been a parasite standing in your way!
        Since Rapture exists in an alternate 1950s, Betty's often a bit behind the times, but she's very forward looking. Sure, she didn't know about cell phones until she arrived from the rift, but she didn't think that they were weird magic when she heard about them. Of course technology would eventually get around to making something so useful. That's what science is for! All of the great problems that plague mankind will, eventually, be solved by bright men and women, she tends to think. It helps that she's naturally quite gifted and able to pick up on new ideas swiftly.
        Her moral clock is a bit behind the modern era in some ways. Even in forward-thinking Rapture, citizens could be a bit more prudish than is generally typical. The taboos against homosexuality or miscegenation weren't quite as strong as they were on the mainland, thanfully, and the general ethos of 'live and let live' tended to prevail. On the other hand, the itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini wasn't popular until two years /after/ Betty left.
        She's also a bit of a nerd. Think Mary from It's a Wonderful Life (particularly the dark timeline). Betty would've been someone's grandmother before being a nerd became 'cool'. So, she's a bit shy and reserved, typically, the sort to hide behind her glasses or her bangs (or both). She was into plasmids and gene tonics back home, her one major way of rebelling against her parents' conservative views. In order to keep her EVE levels high in this realm, she does have to engage in what might be considered bad habits: coffee, nicotine, and alcohol.

<Y-Rated> Linnea glomp Suu.
Noire

        Noire appears to be a beautiful young girl in her mid teens, with rump-length raven black hair worn in twintails, each fastened by a blue and black ribbon. Long bangs drape over her softly angled face and partially conceal large, crimson colored eyes with thick lashes. Her nose and lips are delicate and small, the latter rarely being seen curled into a smile, hiding her perfect white teeth. Her creamy skin flushes ever so slightly over the crest of her high cheekbones, and easily becomes a darker shade with any degree of embarassment.

        Her slender but curvy frame is mostly covered in a complicated outfit consisting of many unattached items. Starting from the top, she wears a frilly blue and white collar with a large, opal clasped, blue and gold ribbon. The tails of the ribbon hang down and overlap the ample cleavage revealing top of her sleeveless white, black, and red dress. Just below her perky young breasts begins a long blue and gold corset, clasped with five golden metallic faux ribbons, though only the top three are fastened around her slender waist. The tails of the corset actually dip slightly lower than the hem of the dress beneath it, almost meeting the top of her lacy white stockings. Which brings one to her legs: Each pretty thigh is exposed only a teasing bit, with the telltale strip of a garter sneaking its way up under her skirt. Blue thigh high boots with white, mildly platformed soles cover the rest of her legs and feet. These boots lace up in the back with white laces, each tied up into a neat bow at the very top. Lastly, unattached sleeves cover each arm from the mid-bicep to her mid-hands. The top of the sleeves are white and frilled to match the hem of her dress, then the rest of the sleeve is blue. Each ends as a partial glove linked around her middle finger, with a large opal on the back of either hand.

        Mafuyu is an onryou, a vengeful ghost and a particularly powerful one at that. Many attempts were made to appease or exorcise her in the past and all have ended in at least one death. The details of her death are unclear, even to her. Time and hatred have clouded her memories of when she was among the living. All she can remember is that it was violent and a haiku that, somehow, is tied to the event. She repeats the verses incessantly. In fact, it appears they're the only things she can say.

<General> Will Never Meet A Unicorn: Geil looks at this answer to the question she had 'what dates can Thanksgiving fall upon.' If the answer is 'fourth thursday of November' then we have a problem with the 22-28 answer. By all calculations in my book, the 28th can never be the 4th thursday of November.
<General> Big in Japan Pelana says, "Huh. I was doing a little research into the whole monster musume/monster girls thing. Apparently a type of ogre that hasn't shown up but in a title card is the 'gigantes', who stand in excess of 10 meters tall. Well, I know what *I'll* play if I ever do such a thing..."
<General> Who Wants to Summon Geil says, "Yet this guy says in 2013 we had a thanksgiving on the 28th"
Geil
        A hellish woman is here. Soft features and a sinfully-sweet smile cannot hide what she is. You are looking at a succubus. She is tall and muscular with skin bronzed by hellfire. She is hot. Any close contact will betray that her body temperature is at least a few degrees warmer than that of a typical human. It's not an uncomfortable heat. It feels the same as being in the arms of a lover underneath a blanket. Her scent is sweet and addicting. There isn't much to it; just a hint of nostalgia from long ago. Even those who are not magically adept can tell that this is a magical creature. Her aura alone muddles the unprotected mind and constantly attacks sensibilities. She constantly looks as if she were viewed through the metaphorical rose-tinted glasses. This is not love at first sight, but her aura would like you to think so.
        So why is she hellish? Well, the upward-pointed, purple horns seem to be a good indicator of this. The demonic wings sprouting from the middle of her uncovered shoulder blades only add to that appeal. If touched, the purple wings would feel as if they were made of the softest down that would put an angel to shame. Her prehensile, spaded tail seems to do whatever it feels like contrary to her will. As if enjoying her warmth it sometimes calmly coils around her thigh. She has ashen-gray hair long enough to touch the backs of her thighs. Her eyes are her most striking features. They are a deep pink with matching heart-shaped pupils. That combined with her warm and beautiful, rounded face makes everything else seem not as important. Her beauty is unnatural. Her hourglass shape, rounded, taut breasts and thick, muscular hips and thighs are all wonderful features and eye candy, but they cannot compare to the allure of her sultry gaze.
        Her clothing looks to have been mostly seared away by extreme heat. Although her negligee is pure white around her breasts, the fur lining it has been charred black. Luckily that heat did not touch the transparent lower frills of the negligee. Similarly the spandex that she wears as stocking and elbow gloves as well as on her panties seems to have melted partially, forming holes to expose her flesh. This disheveled look seems to suit her. She wears a detached collar with a golden skull jewel tied to the front of it. Most of her body is adorned with jewelry of various fashions. Perhaps gifts from a former master; the gold bracers, boots, armbands and other decorative jewelry make her look very exotic.
<General> Burning Hot: Yang Xiao Long contented and relaxed. Squeezes Homu. Shares with her a lovely package of explosive shells in a safe transport container for one of her weapons.
<General> ......... Myan checks calender for 2013.
<Y-Rated> Suu says, "Content aside, I think the thing I love most is how.. alive the art feels."
<General> ......... Myan says, "November 28th was a Thursday."
Meriel has connected.
<Y-Rated> Suu says, "Sometimes you see a serious stiffness despite overwhelming lewdness."
<General> Good Morning, I'm Geil says, "But if that's the case, then the 1st would have been a thursday, making that the 5th thursday"
<General> Delyana'cor says, "Yeah. If the first is on Friday, the 28th can be the 4th Thursday."
<General> Good Morning, I'm Geil boggles
<General> Delyana'cor says, "The 1st Thursday would be the 7th in that case."
<General> Will Never Meet A Unicorn: Geil says, "I'm just overthinking things"
<General> ......... Myan curls up in Geil lap.
<General> ......... Myan purr generates.
<General> Good Morning, I'm Geil says, "I don't even think i'm going to put it into my title anyway-oh my"
<General> Will Never Meet A Unicorn: Geil turns her attention to Myan.

Miki
She stands before with a happy look upon her bright and shining face. She stands about 5'2 . She looks at you with green eyes that still hold a happy innocence around her. Atop her head she has light blue hair that flows down to about the middle of her back. Though something new adorns the top of her head. A pair of cyan furred ears peek up from the top of her head. She has a cyan furred tail that comes out from the base of her back as well. She wears something new. A black dress held to her body closely. It is held up over her shoulders by two thin spaghetti straps and shows off a nice bit of skin but is over all decent looking. It travels down her body showing her curves off nicely. It ends to about halfway between down to her knees. On her feet she wears a pair of simple black sandals to finish off her new outfit.

<General> TransGinger Lauren says, "With the thanksgiving thing, Geil. You're forgetting to add 1. A week after the 1st is not the 7th, but the 8th."
----------------------------------- << Myan's Desc Info >> -----------------------------------

        Pouring from the top of her head are soot black locks of hair that travel down in ankle length pig tails past her shoulders. Jutting up from that hair are her tall feline ears, the outer fur of which are the same soot black as her hair, the guard hairs a softer gray. Upon her head is a black lace bonnet, tied in the back with a silk ribbon of similar color. The bonnet is adorned with a pair of black rose corsages upon the right side. No age lines mar her features in the least. Her eyes are a deep forest green with black vertically slit pupils. Pink lips with a slight upturn are set below a dainty nose upon her face. Her slender jaw dips down into a delicate neck. The flesh showing a lack of heavy outdoor activity with it's pallor.

        Her collar bones spread out from beneath a back and red free hanging separate collar, fastened in place with a small red ribbon bow. At chest level an ash gray slip that descends down past her waist to flare into thigh length petticoats is worn. Her chest is possibly a b cup at the most, not causing much of a swell in the top of that slip at all. Over that slip a black corset is worn, black silk ribbon criss crosses from her chest down to her waist, holding the corset fastened snugly. The ribbon tied in a bow at the chest and waist height to prevent too much slack from forming. Myan's arms are covered by a pair of bicep length black opera gloves.

        From the bow cinched waist of that corset descends the wide frilled flair of it's skirt. The soot black garment adorned with several rows of pleated black folds to add volume before descending down to ankle length. The front of the garment is left open to reveal the mid thigh length gray petticoats of the slip. Worn at her hip, as if it were a sheathed weapon is a large blue leather bound volume adorned with silver bindings and scroll work. In a tubular pencase next to it is an ornate silver quill. Should opportunity arise, a pair of red and black striped panties might be seen under those petticoats. Her lower thighs and legs are quite safely covered by black stockings that run down into a pair of red ankle boots fastened with leather laces.

Terra Branford

        The girl in front of you wears a large red ribbon in her long, mint-gree hair, tying the curly strandss into a poytail behind her head, her shiny blue eyes contrasting her pale skin as she returns your gaze curiously.

        A short red and sleeveless dress, reaching just to her thighs, covers her petite body. Contrasting the skin of her bare shoulders and her little cleavage as well, a little floral pattern adorning the side of her dress down to her waist. Her arms are covered with matching fingerless elbow gloves. Her waist is emphasized by a layered sash, colored in place blue, pink and yellow with her long saber sheathed inside it and hidden under the long red cloack behind her back.

        Her slender legs are covered in light blue pantyhose, little pink flowers sprinkled over the sheer fabruc all the way down towards her red boots, little golden heels making her stand a little taller than she is.
